Very Little Work Life Balance
"organizations is an amazing place to work, learn and grow - quickly. Your peers are best in class, and you will learn more in one year than you will at other companies in 10 years. organizations pays well through salary, bonus, and most importantly - stock."
"Bright and engaging people, amazing financial and non-financial benefits, healthy work life balance. Easily the biggest advantage of working at organization is the people; extremely intelligent, team oriented, and genuine."

If you aren't in shape it gets tough and you just become physically and mentally exhausted. It is a lot of walking.
If working in Customer Service be aware that you'll get every type of customer imaginable.
Some metrics you get rated on are outside of your control. You still need to find solutions to those uncontrolled outcomes by creating new solutions to increase your culture of safety.
"As a virtual employee there is little opportunity to speak with someone by voice. 99% of communication is done by email and/or chat messaging - this can be very time consuming and leads to much frustration. Entry level pay is very poor with no room for negotiation. If overtime needs are not meet voluntarily, mandatory overtime is distributed w/o notice."
"Long hours with only two 15 minute breaks and half hour lunch, so to have to stand on concrete without being able to sit is hard. Good luck trying to get the days that work for your life when you start. They tell you what days yo have to work. Either except it or move on. Do not get sick while working there. People have gotten fired for fainting at work. If you aren't fast enough to make a ridiculously high rate, the??Show More"
Good health benefits. Hourly wage is very fair for the area. Working conditions are decent. I work inside most of the time.

Your feet hurt when you first start but you'll get used to it after a while!
they need to pay more money
"potential long hours depending on your time management, also requires lots of friendliness and networking which is great unless you're an introvert"
upper management doesn't take middle management seriously.
"It's still a business, there are still offices... you'll never escape some aspects of a typical job"
"Incredibly diverse company hires and acquires way too many mediocre people, bad managers prevail."
"Great benefits, surrounded by smart/motivated people, lots of perks, locations around the world, 401K match, health benefits are outstanding"
"tons of perks, dog friendly"
"Big company, outside of your immediate team/department there isn't a strong sense of local community. It's hard to see impact importance of your work if you're in a large organization."
Exciting to work in a company that powers billions of people's lives everyday.
"It is hard to get noticed. The imposter syndrome is strong. Promotions require extraordinary work. It really pastas to be self motivating, and self promoting. You need to get decent per reviews from your co workers"
great pay at starting at 13.25 an hour. very flexible hours
"Smart people, customer-centric approach, brand recognition and prestige"
"No direction, guidance or training. It was literally sink or swim. The content of what we were working on was not interesting or challenging and when tried to shift to other projects, we were told that we could only do this one thing. Usually a good manager will help their employees find a project where they can build their strengths. I think they didn't really care if we left, but thought, ""hey we can always hire mo… Show More"
Pay is low and lots of walking
Working with many different people and products. You get the opportunity to voice your opinions on subjects that matter to you and someone will actually follow up with you. Different shift patterns and different days so it makes it somewhat flexible.
"Not the best paying for industry standards. Mangers are always replaceable (and frequently are). Even if you do an awesome job, you're hamstringed by coworkers who don't care."
"Teamwork, high velocity logistics, processes, and variety embrace the experiences at an organizations Fulfillment Center"
"organization's hiring process is a bear, which made it very difficult as a recruiter. Making meaningful and non-trivial suggestions often fell on deaf ears."
Lots of competition for positions and slow up-ward mobility
"Work-life balance can be difficult, not necessarily due to management asking you to work off-hours, but because sometimes it's hard to disconnect."
More diversity would be nice

work load can be taxing at times dues to required finishing times in order to make numbers.

Work/life balance.
"Perfect Salary, work enviroment"
Zero work life balance. Offers a tuition program but you are paid so lowly that you will never use it as most employees will qualify for a Pell Grant. Top out at $2 more than your starting salary after two years.
"Large corporation, so it has typical big company problems- hard to have career growth, promotions are difficult to get, decent amount of bureaucracy, you are one among many people, etc."
intern work may not be valuable to the company. fortunately mine was production
Downside are lazy people like most jobs and favoritism.
"Great perks--food is amazing and everywhere, bus service allows me to work while commuting, lots of on-campus amenities."
It may be some boring in organization recent years.
Over qualified people could lead to lack of motivation at times
The pay is pretty low
The organization is very flat with lots of Type A personalities meaning that its pretty cut throat to move up.
The speed at which organizations is growing resonates across the company.
"If you can dream it, share why it adds value to the Company, you can build. It's an amazing place to be part of, literally changing eCommerce daily."
"Some management can be very horrible to work for. A lot of management is young kids straight out of college and don't know anything about discipline, how to control a numerous about of people. Management doesn't respect the hourly warehouse employees much. No real chance of moving up of being promoted. Job could be hard on the body physically and mentally."
Competitive compensation. World renown perks. Very smart coworkers. Impactful projects.
"awesome people, great perks, best place to launch a career."
"Great company to work for, fun times and challenging problems every day of the week. great food also."
Inconsistent management of departments and individuals.
"It is a some what tight nit community, and they also seem to really care about you. They also care about making sure everyone is safe and comfortable. There was no tolerance for messing around with the machines."
organizations is a challenging and opportunistic company. I have been given the freedom to propose new ideas and implement network wide changes. organizations has helped develop me through working in different FC's and departments in my career.
Smartest collection of co-workers I've experienced
All of the perks are incredible!
I worked at the Local fulfillment center in Tampa as a seasonal hire. You'll be working 5x11 shifts so be prepared for that. Use your sick days wisely. It must be said that all of the managers i met were very nice and understanding.
"Great hours, flexible with class schedule"
Access/exposure to a lot of cool projects before they are widely known to the public and your foot in the door to landing a full time position with the company
Not a lot of hours
The other associates aren't well suited for the job.
The holidays will bring in some very annoyed customers
Metrics are not fair. Could do better.
"(1) Too many smart people, too much conflict. There is saying in organization, ""Welcome to organization, where impossible stuff is easy, and easy stuff is impossible"""
"The job is utterly, mind numbingly boring."
"Competitive, because everyone you work with is also very talented."
There are not many Cons in this business so thanks everyone
I worked in the Biz Dev side of the AWS partner team for 2.5 years and loved it. The pace of innovation at AWS is mind blowing. The products and services that the team works with are market leading and the opportunity before AWS is staggering. I thoroughly enjoyed my 2.5 years there and would have happily stayed for me. I was scooped up by an AWS partner to lead an even bigger opportunity.
"Managers that listen, plenty of O.T."
Terrible work-life-balance. No one likes on call.
Very tedious work; almost no innovation.
For me it has been tedious. As a picker The job is not hard but the hours drag and by the end most people seem to be tired and wanting to go home. The managers try and make us feel energized and positive about the day but I still dread those 10 hours of walking back and forth the mods without really stopping because it might affect your rate. It is also not the best in work-life balance. The job can be draining and e??Show More
small fish in a big sea.
Very aggressive sales targets. The team has experienced significant growth over the past 5 years and many partners are reaching a ceiling. The expectation is to continue a 40% YoY growth which is difficult to maintain.
all positive nothing bad to say
"There is a definite ceiling to how far you can go, the raises tier needs work, peak season is always a rough time for your personal life"
I love this job! It's very easy and the hiring process is simple and easy
"so large scale (hopefully more addressable with the new restructuring) that similar projects spawn at different offices that couldve been better generalized and collaborated on if there had been a better platform for discovering ongoing or pitched projects. Had a very positive experience with my first internship, but my second felt more overbearing and too broad to be polished on delivery by the end of my internship.… Show More"

"I think there are no cons here, unless I lied. And I don't wanna do that"
It's a wonderful job great pay all over fun working inviorment.
Free food- they have professional chefs
"there is really no downside to organization. As an employee, I have access to resources and great training and coaching. Please hire my friends as well."
I was a seasonal employee which they do to a lot of people so they don't have to pay benefits.
"I've gone from a new grade hire to the tech lead of a 8 person team in 2 1/2 years, and I've learned a ton along the way. Not every engineer you'll work with is amazing, some are just good, and a few are mediocre. However, so many are amazing that it's an absolute pleasure to work on the same codebase as they do."
"Can be hard to feel like you're making an impact or get recognition in such a large company, especially a remote office."
"Entrepreneurial culture, very dynamic projects. The teams are made up of some of people with some of the most diverse backgrounds I have ever seen."
You do not get your own office. When you work it is mostly an open floor plan.
Benefits and incentives are amazing at organizations.
"Very friendly people and very interesting work. The working environment is very nice and we only need to worry about work we are responsible for, and anything else is well taken care of by other assistants and applications."
Challenging status quo and building software for a better tomorrow.
"Great company, great people. One of the biggest benefits is being able to reference organizations as a recent workplace on your resume."
Everyone comes to know EVERYONE!!!!
It's organization after all! I had a great time working there and my co-workers were quite supportive.
"Lot of opportunity for work and fun. Agree that is #1 place to work for. Good food, good peers and good projects."
Great program with lots of visibility and cool projects
"result oriented , does not matter how hard you try"
Bad living place for an engineer
"1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at organization who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.

"Sometimes, obsessing over customers can be a compulsive behavior that means the company is overlooking the wellbeing of the ""owners"" (organizations-speak for employees).

"Teamwork, always someone who can help, competitive, fun environment, free food, intelligent colleagues everywhere"
I don't really see any cons of working at organization. I decided to leave because I wanted to be closer to my family
Working for organizations you have so many opportunities to grow and move within the company.
"You're working with the smartest people in the industry on a lot of tough problems, so expectations are high. But there is a lot to learn if you pay attention, and the teammates are very supportive"
They take very good care of their employees and I do miss working there. Always a good schedule and two thumbs up
Some people take advantage of it too much
"It is easy to get lost and overwhelmed if you do not have a clear role and desire to continuously grow. If you get complacent or if you do not pay attention to surrounding teams, you probably will not be there long."
nice salary and internal work environment
Slow growth in a matter of 10 years
"As a contractor, there is a pretty clear hierarchical thing working there. Some conferences and info are limited, and no freedom to do what you want."
The projects are fast paced so be prepared. We work nonstop although it's not always a serious environment. During breaks we tend to avoid talking about work because we are always so busy with it.
"- everyone is so smart, it's hard to stand out"
Too much work to do in a time
I did see any bad about organizations I had a wonderful time and it was a true blessing to have found a place like organizations
"Big company, famous company, can learn lots of things to improve myself"
Promotions are based on politics. For management & HR: Many TLMs pick favorites and reduce opportunities for others by restricting project allocations. Encourage 6-month transfers to help employees find better and cohesive teams where they will happily remain and let others move. It'll also let bad teams / TLs get smaller and atrophy which is good for organization overall.
"- Size of the company is huge, so don't expect startup culture."
"Great environment, lots of opportunities"
"Good people, monthly bonus, lots of people to talk to, overtime opportunities, chance for advancement, prizes for attendance"
For this job I don't think there are any cons.
Your surrounded by great interesting people and the culture that is fostered and cultivated at organizations is wonderful.
Everyone is vibrant and high-energy. Truly a fun place to get your nerd on. Oh and we do work sometimes. The campus is huge and contains many perks such as a gym and cafeteria.
Nothing is bad about organization
It is become bigger and layered. Most of the time you don't know which part you are working on within the huge system.
when things get backed up
High school playground with associates
"Commute is tough, if you don't like shuttles."
"There was a growing number of employees that were simply ""resting and vesting"" so it became discouraging for those of us who wanted to make an impact. Felt like it was becoming more about MBAs who know nothing about marketing taking over and ideas were becoming less and less creative. People were less willing to take a risk."
"It looks really good on a resume. People always ask about it. Safety walks, gemba. It is great if you are young and with out a family."
"Great benefits, good coworkers, awesome company."
Very little structure with a lot of moving parts.
"Most managers are nice and helpful,"
"Internal code base is huge, it takes long time to get familiar with it. Promotion system is a bit flaky and is not refocused on impact rather than quality"
Take Warehouse associate ideas
"great perks, great place to be"
Great coworkers and a ton of opportunities.
"Not every team is equal, some have it really rough, but a lot don't."
"Great benefits and work-life balance, smart people and interesting products"
Work could be stressful in some groups. I sometimes heard coworkers in some other groups talking about working overtime to get assignment done.
"A lot of responsibility. Exciting. Fantastically smart, capable, and fun colleagues. Great salary and benefits. Lots of international travel. Entrepreneurial culture."
They dont really give you that much spending money during the school year for your marketing events. Communication is very poor during the school year as well.
Duplicative efforts / often reinventing the wheel.
organization is perhaps the best big corporation you can work for which is well known so I don't have to write much here.
"The company offers fair wages and amazing great for all types of employees, and provides daily incentives to maximize productivity. It's a great first job, or an opportunity to explore an area in the field of logistics."
"Great place to work, lots of places to eat and drink"
No cons that I can think of
It was okay. Easy work
"great compensation, great perks, brilliant coworkers. The food there is amazing, great leisure time and freedom to pursue my own interests."
Great people to work with. Great leaders also
Nothing really. You need to compete very hard as everyone seems to be brilliant!!
Laid back west coast culture
"*Downtown Seattle traffic is getting difficult and the public transportation has gotten worse over the years. I spend 9 enjoyable years taking the bus, but now must drive myself."
Role can be confusing at first
The physical labor is hard on the back
"freindly place to work, job requirements are easy to learn, fast paced environment, help from other workers is readily available"
Good Culture. Used to have lot of parties for interns.
"A lot of politics, hard to grow"
I work nights and my manager has to be the worst for many reasons. If it werent for her i would love my job lol. Oh and the hr is very rude.
Focused on results.
Less salary and hard work
"get treated like a nobody, its all who you know in order to move up, employees dont matter"
"Super smart people, great infrastructure, access to lots of users. Potential for big impact."
Good money.Interaction with some great minds in the world during internal conferences and sessions.Of course the pride of being a part of earth's most customer centric experience
"Mountain View centric. If you are remote, then your opinion is much less important. Some of the departments are very hierarchical."
this job has really given me insight out the job game really works. I learned how to develop software in my spare time and always love the cafeteria
To many managers. To many meetings. Favoritism place a huge role with management.
It was great. It was a different time but it was great.
I have no cons to add
"Bureaucracy, challenges to promotion, competitive."
"organization has very good benefit including health insurance, 401k and free breafast, lunch, dinner."
#NAME?
"I can't stand the fact that it's no work-life balance. The 10 hour schedules suck, I'd rather work 8 hours shifts 5 days a week. You have to go through too much to get promoted when people you train get promoted before you. it's so much I can say but I'm going to keep at a minimum"
"Have several family members working here. Good base pay, starting hours are good. A half hour lunch. Really good coworkers. Nice management."
If you search you will find opportunities to grow and learn new things.
The office space is outdated. Could use new radio equipment.
The resident at the facility was very nice. My Co-workers were also nice. There was good teamwork even though we were short staff.
Great Pay
"Very smart people and flexibility to choose your projects, to choose your research areas. Overall I think my coworkers are extremely well qualified for their job."
Since it is such a big company you can also get lost very easily. There are lots of custom proprietary tools that some people at organization only know how to use. And obviously that knowledge would be useless outside of organization. Understanding the interluding concepts is on the other hand useful.
"During the time I was at organization, I have had the pleasure to work with smart, savvy, and dedicated people who truly have passions for what we do - it is contagious."
Experience is highly dependent on getting a good direct manager that will work to get you promoted and shield you from politics
Pretty Simple and straight foward. Friendly people.

"could work any hours, long hours"
Amazing benefits
no major cons to mention

Best reason to work for organizations is definitely the benefits and insurance that they provide. It is amazing that I don't have to worry so horribly over dr bills anymore!!!

Not a single thing I can think of
"Consistent hours as a direct hire. 18 hours with pay guarantee. 30 days until dental and vision. 90 days until medical, which is far better than most part-time positions out there. Free beverages in the break-room, reduced costs of snacks in the vending machines. Plenty of work when the shipments are accounted for correctly. Advancement is swift if you are open to doing anything asked of you without an attitude."

"There may be many on-calls in some group, work pressure is high"
The pay there is good and they give good hours
hr needs to get people who actually want to help
You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.
Great place to work and to develop.
GREAT benefits with stock and health insurance. Pay is not outstanding but stock makes up for it.
has become very political/career growth is much slower/comp is not great
organization offers real challenge to employees that want to work hard
"Good pay, good benefits, good people"
Good pay master
no option to work from remote office
organization is a blatantly liberal company.
The hours can fluctuate and shifts are approx. 12 hours long. Almost all managers work a weekend day and half of the management team works a night shift schedule. The remarkably high demands can sometimes be too much for teams to handle.
"organization has amazing people working there, and they are eager to help you learn as much as possible. The other benefits are just icing on the cake."
"They offer some good benefits and the pay is decent starting out,depending on your area. They provide paid maternity leave as well as continuing education benefits."
organization is obviously a large company so sometimes it's difficult to feel your individual work is making a difference in the larger scope.
"Heavy work load, not a streamlined process for interns"
big company lots of options / teams
Call center environment stressful and you must work hard. Breaks are monitored. No room for growth. The training is not relevant. Your pay depends on customer ratings. Cultural divisions. Management micro manages. Pushing people to take calls. You must work weekends. Low pay compared to competitors. Poor ergonomics and the benefits are very poor. HIGH TURNOVER.
"Very biased towards whatever engineering wants, creating unfair conditions for everyone else."
"Visionary leadership, interesting products, great brand, great perks, very focused on employee development/growth"
Great concept to work for.
organization is still a big and established company. There will still be a corporate hierarchy that will take months or years to change compared to quick feedback within a startup.
Company becoming big....lots of team to interact and work with. Work life balance compromised if not paid attention to.
The company offers generous perks. The locations of headquarters and other offices are great.
"Delivering and insisting on the highest standards is not for everyone. If you're working on product launches and it becomes crunch time then you are likely to be working harder than a regular 9-5 job. With that said, though, I've got many friends who manage a good work life balance. Some roles make that easier than others so it's worth choosing wisely. organizations isn't a company that coddles its employees though...so if???Show More"
Competition is fierce among peers. Middle-management is hit-or-miss. The pace is grueling and relentless.
It takes time to get promoted and there are always tons of emails to check!
There are not any cons
The best part of the job is when you just talk with your mates and have fun because thats what it is all about.
Packing: It's incredibly monotonous and soul draining
"Great work schedule, great coworkers,"
Living the organization life.
getting very large in size
big organization and it's hard to get noticed
"Working in a climate controlled environment, casual dress code. Large break room with TVs and vending machines. Lots of open communication between management and regular employees daily"
"I've been with organizations for over 8 years, working as an Sr. Software Development Engineer currently on-track to a likely Principal Engineer promotion within a few years."
"I'm a recruiter for the eCommerce Platform group, and love it here. As a tech recruiter, I'm hiring software engineers and managers, PMs, support engineers and data engineers."
Plenty of perks. Very flexible with scheduling. No one on one interviews.
"There benifits are good,and it will bring you a lot of good things for your family."
"Hard to move inside the org, very political and given its huge size it is much harder to grow in this company than elsewhere. Salaries might be amazing or terrible, and it all depends on the country, its taxes and your level in the company unfortunately, not the job."
"co-operation, High salary, new technologies ... etc"
There are no other better companies in the world
"Growth potential, benefits, innovation, community contribution, health care,"
NA
Easy to recruiter folks when you have a big brand like organization behind you. My manager was generally available and was great about internal mobility.
Gained 20lbs.
Its a big company so its sometimes slow and sometimes very fast paced which can be time consuming
"Good benefits, fairly good pay, casual environment. People bring their dogs with them to work. Nice location in downtown Seattle."
#NAME?
"rains a lot, a little bit cold in the winter"
"the hours are too long, you have to stand up the whole shift, you can't bring your phone in, there's no entertainment to keep you focused, it's always freezing, it's way too loud, the breaks are too short"
Good work life balance.
hard to show yourself among others to develop your career path
Great Working Environment. Great Perks
You get paid enough and the work isn't difficult.
"Lots of opensource , good environment"
"As it gets larger, it gets slower, more dysfunctional, less efficient."
"Fast Paced, Friendly Management and a Nice Facility with top of the line break and computer room."
"Get to bring your dog to work, very nice people, very smart people"
No downsides to me thinking of work for this company.
"Technology, company structure, scale. SDE teams are encouraged to operate like startups while leveraging the power of a robust and active internal technology stack"
Good for most of the things
All the benefits are amazing.
Sink or swim mentality that doesn't value people development as much as it should.
Good company. Good benefits. Smart people
Managers Should give more feedback to temps.
"This organization never sits still. We are always consistently trying to disrupt the status quo if not creating a whole new vertical. It's amazing to see how nimble an organization of this size can be. Finally, the people you work with are just amazing - extremely intelligent, hardworking and understand that boundaries only exist in the mind."
"It's a good company, good place to work and good place to learn."
Peer review makes you think why others are smiling at you all the time.
"Great benefits, solid pay, very casual atmosphere and fairly supportive local (DFW) staff."
Some of the people are rude and don't listen to you so just make sure to select the right teammates in your groups.
They do so much for the world. Amazing projects and initiatives taking place at the company.
Huge infrastructure for employee benefits. Low risk. Work with smart people. Free food is convenient and healthy. Buses make the commute more tolerable. People usually given a high degree of independence and trust.
Non-traditional sales roles that only use the complex AdWords platform
None It was the harshest place I have ever worked where the employee had no value
"It can be daunting to start since you have to get used to all the tools (there are a lot of tools, especially organization specific tools)."
"Lots of hours, lower than average pay, lots of management change, most managers are fresh out of school, many have never actually worked before."
Training should be longer then a week. And they should stick to what they believe is good customer service for customers packages being delivered to their home or business. Not everybody should not be a blue badge.
"Team vary greatly. Many people are type A, bold and unapologetic, and it is common to see that people are eager to point out others mistakes in order to make themselves look good. A little bit cut-throat. Many employees lack work life balance"
Great benefits. Amazing attendance policy and lots of paid time off and vacation time available as soon as you start.
really great opportunity to network and meet new people.
Good place to work and learn alot.
"great work environment ,some times"
Company is becoming bigger so there is lot of competition for projects and promotions.
"Management could do with providing a little more support when absolutely needed. Training materials were lacking, but not awfully so."
organizations is pretty frugal and it doesn't give you perks. Depending on the team you could work long hours.
"Not a fan of being on-call, particularly as the number of services your team owns grows, since we're always writing new services and many issues only come up in production. Very fast paced work environment, and very smart coworkers, doesn't leave a lot for work-life balance"
The environment was very fast paced with emphasis on shipping products as quickly as possible while still maintaining a high quality bar.
Company is getting big and lost some of the original culture.
The company is too big to get anything done reasonably easy.
"Constant restructuring, always had to ""prove"" self to new management, difficult review cycle (which improved slightly shortly after I left)"
Healthcare plan
"Opportunity for vertical movement is scarce. Hiring practices have led to hiring candidates based on who has the best resume, rather than who is the best person for the job. Culture of ladder climbing slows down productivity and leads to a lot of people being stepped on."
great perks and great work environment.
after a while it gets boring
"Nice pay, knowledgeable staff, I had a great manager."
It's amazing to be part of such an innovative company. We are constantly pushing boundaries of what is possible and accelerating delivery to the customer.
Short breaks
The office politics are harsh.
Great perks. Flexible schedule. Meet great people.
very good company to join
Fun and easy rewarding job
it was a really rich and positive experience
Great opportunities to work on far-reaching and impactful projects. Definitely worth working there. Lots to learn. Could be worth the challenge to your work/life balance.
"Because working for organizations Operations is a very results driven and rapidly changing career, the stressful work environment might not be for everyone. Each fulfillment center however has strong leadership in place and encourages obtaining help from peers if struggling with projects or change."
Managment sucks
"Working in Mountain View. Living nearby is undesirable, but living someplace desirable means a 90+ minute commute."
"Workaholics, intense competition, constant game of thrones! Contractors are sort of a sub-class, make less money, have limited access to meetings, projects and facilities (for the same position)."
Some internal group (eg. corp-eng) has management that's not on par with the rest of the company.
The only thing about working for organizations is that it looks good on resume
None that I have felt.
"All the frustrations of working in a large, flat organization: especially if you're trying to get anything done cross-functionally, takes awhile to figure out how ""the world works"" and deal with navigating the organizational structure. Where I was in the organization, pace and rapid change of projects could be challenging at times."
Huge scale can be overwhelming
"Depending on the department, bureaucracy can quite a problem. There were obvious ways to make things better, but the top leaders were either uninvolved and focused on other 'sexier' projects, or were never given the honest/critical information. Inefficiencies weren't fixed because teams and departments were built around how things worked (not optimally). This led to management pushing and trying to exceed targets in … Show More"
You have to consider your career path and progress yourself.
"You have to be self motivated. NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you"
#NAME?
"Good infrastructure, good people to work with, nice perks."
"Not enough pay, but I could get better at marketing."
"If you find yourself in a tight-knit crew, stay there as long as you can. The biggest ""pros"" will be ones you carve out for yourself over a long period of time."
One of the best companies you could ever hope to work for
"good benefits, guaranteed 40hrs a week, paid time off , ect"
Great place to work!
Always in rush
"Lots of mobility, opportunities to be creative and take the lead."
Exciting place to work
"Great company to say you work of and it's a huge learning opportunity. Generally feel a sense of accomplishment as an owner of a team of people.Your peers will be extremely smart and motivated. The standards here are very high and you will be challenged every day. In this job I am never bored, the pace is very fast.You get to work with some of the smartest, most capable people, on the most interesting problems. Lots???Show More"
Awesome work . scope to learn many new things
Your work gets a lot of exposure.
"Great perks, work environment, free food"
Big company. Political. A lot of red tape
"Communication is organizations's biggest problem. With everything. No matter what department your in or which department your dealing with. None of the mangers know how to communicate with one another or to their employees. If your pregnant, HR will give you a run of the mill of forcing you into the hands of LOA by saying the have no work (even though it's half-true, they rather not pay you) and if you haven't been employed??Show More"
You can get stuck with a lazy crew and it makes it more difficult for you to do your job.
"You get used to saying ""things area really crazy right now,"" and eventually realize that's just how things operate. Learning to say no and balance your own schedule is critical, because it's rare to have someone else do that for you and there's no shortage of great things to go contribute to."
challenging hard work that takes time
Exciting product launches and hands-on training
organization set the bar for what all companies should strive for regarding culture and benefits. But the true secret to organization's success is a management philosophy of hiring the best people and trusting them to do their own work without top down hierarchical direction.
Innovation and new Ideas are abundant. Expanding into new markets at a fast pace. They are one of the top cloud network providers in the industry.
"The work is interesting, and not tedious or boring. The expectations are not unreasonable. There is room to grow, ands expand ones skill set using the 20% time. Coworkers are amazing and one learns a lot. Perks are pretty awesome"
"Nice benefits, good hours, good pay"
great company to work for
"Need to go out of your way to ask questions and be independent, otherwise you'll drift behind on your work."
"Great hours, able to work from home, awesome benefits for anyone that sells a lot of items through them."
"Communication is terrible, work/life not so great, employees treated as robots or commodities and not people. organizations will try to pay you as little as possible and unless you get a really great boss, they aren't going to help you develop."
sometimes over time working. Normal salary
last minute unplanned meetings can be a bit frustrating.
"Fun, caring, and overall great environment."
"You work hard, but it is rewarding. There is a strong network of dedicated leaders who will help you succeed if you put in the effort."
"No micromanagement, employees are empowered."
"Leading edge, always something new, challenges are always right around the corner, never a dull moment. Anytime feedback is good when used the correct way."
The company name obviously comes with perks
"They hire smart, and they pay for hard work"
#NAME?
It is a fun and exciting place for anybody to work with all the new and exciting things that they envint.
"AWS lives by its Leadership Principles which is mostly a good thing. If these principles resonate with you then you'll be good. If they do not then don't work there. However, there is no Principle around treating employees well. The closest is Hire & Develop the Best but that does not quite mean treating employees with respect. Within some groups at AWS it can be quite harsh. That was not my experience but I hear??Show More"
"Smart people, hard working, well known"
Too much Work!
"Compensation is great. Learning on and designing ginormous micro-service based architectures. It's a great chance to learn how to design huge, scalable, fault-tolerant systems."
"Work culture, salary, benefits, trainings and poor communication."
I would say that the only thing I can say would be a Con working for organization would be if you didn't work for them anymore.
"Manager level is tough and rude, no management skills at all. not good for life and work balance. get phone call at 3:00am of midnight, lower pay, cheap company"
Bad schedules. Young managers with no management experience.
"Coding workflow and tools are streamlined and integrated, allowing you to focus on codin, solving problems, and working with team members."
Didn't have any down sides
Did not allow sleeping on the job
"organization is continuing to grow and as we do, it is increasingly bureaucratic... the quality of senior leaders is now uneven, and there is a level of uncertainty about the company's direction from senior executives."
"Large, corporate, and difficult to rise up after a certain point in your career"
"Good benefits, Smart people, great culture"
Perks could have been better for a largely based sales company.
Not much to do here
"High IQ employees, always learning, being at the edge of innovation"
Employees are almost exclusively from top tier universities and privileged backgrounds. Relative lack of intellectual and cultural diversity.
"Health Benefits are great, You cant find better."
You have to work long hours
"Culture, People, Experience, Mobility, Pace"
"Communication between the customer service site and the ""heads of the business"" in Seattle could be better"
can be rigid in change management.
"Long working days (no more than 12hrs/day), lots to remember, pressure can build up for short periods of time."
Perks are too many to mention and with so many smart people to follow around you're going to learn a lot!
"great benefits, fun environment, job stability, working on amazing projects with smart people that impact the whole world"
"The program was very unstructured. A lot of us were confused what were could and couldn't do after ""orientation."" If you ask me, a lot of the events hosted by ambassadors representing the company were poorly run/planned which in turn made the company look bad (some ambassadors did a better job than others)"
"Great company, good technology exposure, good ownership model and usually the teammates are smart and nice and projects are impactful."
Work life balance is great. Free food.
"None really, everything was great so no complaints from me."
"Huge resources available, world-class brilliant people to work with. Great place to learn how to scale real-world systems."
"clean environment ,plenty of work if your willing to work overtime.very good benefits ,including tuition for school,bonuses(vcp),paid time off"
"Depending on team, can be stressful and unreasonable"
Management sucks
work life balance. good working environment
"Smart coworkers, open culture, many challenging problems, good compensation, many good benefits if you take advantage of them"
"Easy, no customers. When you become a problem solver you have to use your head a bit which is nice. Stressful but I enjoy it"
"they were ok, good management, good environment"
"Little autonomy to get stuff done, difficult to get promotion, Henry Ford model of repetition being deployed all over"
"Lots of autonomy, fun place to work, talented co-workers"
"There isn't anything I didn't like about my job, the people around me, or the facility. It was an all around great expirence."
There are no cons to working at organizations.
"My family life suffered. Although I had a lot of success, I failed to manage my personal life and what I did each day wasn't scalable long term"
Work was hard but fair. Sometimes the work felt like it never ended.
Not enough hours in the fulfillment centers.
Ok Money easy to get hired
organizations is one of the most fast paced work environments I've ever witnessed. Combined with the encouragement of innovation and owning your work you can choose to success or fail. If you are successful you are also well rewarded.
I don't think I had any bad experience while working as an intern. Interns were treated as kings.!
None the atmosphere is great wonderful work condition and great salery so working at organization is fantastic and very nice co workers
"Free food, nice environment, decent salary, good company reputation, and a lot more great things."
Extra money during Christmas time .Overtime if you need it
"There are always more interesting things to do than hours in the day, and organizations will take as much time as you give. You have to be willing to set and enforce your own limits to maintain work/life balance. That means saying 'no' to things that seem super interesting."
Smart people: Hiring bar is very high.
One is expected to deliver the best
"They really care about your personal career path as well as your quality of life, so I got a really kind impression while I was an intern there. I also loved playing volleyball, and the Mountain View campus had great access to sand volleyball courts!"
"Decent pay and benefits, good bonuses and stock grants. Some really inspiring and talented coworkers. Learning opportunities. Some travel if you want it."
Hours pay are pretty good
Diversity of employee not close to home or lack of individual recognition.
Work laborious/10 hr shift
"no flexibility, standing for long periods of time. short breaks, and they expect you to be back 3 minutes early."
Fun environment and great people to work with
"the politics, the pressure, the stress, the backstabbing, cutthroat colleagues, the lack of transparency, constant reorgs, lack of job security, the disposability of employees, lies from management. Human Resources team is a ship of fools."
"Stress cesspit. I have been stressed ever since I have joined over a year ago with 2 weeks not being extremely stressed during Holidays, and then back to constantly being stressed out. There is a constant push, you have to juggle multiple tasks at once while expected to have quality which translates to ton of hours. I think I worked more weekends than I had free weekends, get ready to work tons of hours."
working for long hours sometimes
"Nice environment, good food, many fun"
The hands on model requires lots of work and is challenging to scale. Keeping all the students engaged and growing is a big responsiblity and requires constant vigilance.
* Friendly and smart co worker
Totally nothing is bad about the GooG!
"Work/life balance. I worked 10-12 hours a day and was exhausted. They don't tell you that you need to work that many hours, but if you want to get promoted then you have to put in the effort."
Not very employee friendly. They will push you to hit rates that are a bit extreme. Mandatory overtime that may not be announced until the day before. Long shifts. You may get a three day weekend but the first day is catching up on sleep.
Great place to build a career nice Benifits and can move up with the hard work and some manger willing to help build your portfolios.
You get promoted by chatting with people and doing nothing important.
"back stabbers and glory seekers will surround you, local management needs more technical background"
Whatever you can think of! I feel like a king when I'm at work. I absolutely love my job!!!!
"Decent, pick own hours. They do provide uniforms as well as badges and hats and you are allowed to keep any tips you have ."
No cons at all. Great place
Job can be repetitive and boring. Nothing new to learn.
"not enough experience, very young company."
Fun great excellent amazing outstan
"Expected to work at maintain quick pace, even for sales. The pace makes it difficult to enjoy all of the pros listed above."
Best company to work at as a fresher
Working with a high number of clients all over the world increased my ability to be customer orientated and also detail orientated which was one of the most important facts in my job
They take great care of us.
Justification to purchase tools for the work is quick and easy
We made the best tacos
"We had personal time, we sometimes received cola cash where we can buy stuff from the store inside of organizations."
"Hard to move up at the company unless you're a kiss up or know someone higher up, a lot of lazy coworkers, demanding rate, if you can't keep up, you will be fired, you will get hurt eventually."
Most jobs are in MTV where cost of living is extremely high even when making almost $100K
It was a pleasant work environment.
No cons come to mind
"little impact, small rolls, politics, people just waiting for retirement there"
Not much opportunities to rise up in the company. Also the training process was difficult because of all the people they hired at the time. Seems to be run by a lot of young and inexperienced people.
"Takes a while to get things done because of the size of the company you need to make sure noone else is working on what you're working on, and even if they are you can still do it anyway if you think you're better at politics."
"The people are among the smartest, most driven co-workers. This made it a fantastic experience."
"Great perks, talented employees. Flexible hours, interesting projects - easy to move from team to team. Physical health prioritized with facilities on campus."
"I get to use some very advanced tools. organizations is a large company so there are in-house utilities for everything. An interesting part of working at AWS is that the services are built on top of other AWS services. There are very few use cases for third-party infrastructure. If you have a problem with one of the services, you can engage with engineers on that service's team directly instead of having to go through custo??Show More"
"I work at one of their fulfillment centers, and it is very hard work. That is, if you are a hard worker. It seems like the lazy people get to stick to the easier jobs. However, I'm sure their jobs are less secure."
"Compared with many of my previous jobs which offered little to know benefits, organizations offers a great and varied amount. Even within my short time of working with organizations I am already seeking promotion opportunities."
"Overall great experience, haven't found any."
#NAME?
This was the most poorly managed operation I have ever worked for.
Not a single con working here.
fast growing company with a lot of potential
"There are not really any cons, people here complain but why complain in a warehouse job. The public really outs us like it's a bad company. Love it l."
I dont have any thing to say bad about the company
"The open office layout is noisy and distracting - it's possible to cope, but I really wish we had separate cubes or offices."
"Some areas of the company are hard to work for, the Fulfillment Center is one of the worst for IT."
"Your development expertise will grow immensely. You are surrounded by some of the smartest engineers in the world, so you learn a lot"
"Imposter syndrome. For me, long commute. Twenty percent time is hard to make time for. The delicious food will make you fat."
"organization has a very open culture. Granted, being a large company, its ideals aren't always met, but the the culture of the company is to constantly strive to meet them. Among all the current large companies in the world, the culture is vastly superior."
The project asked to do is not hard. Our mentor is actually very nice.
"strong financial, lavish perks, smart people to learn from"
"The perks are legendary here. Contrary to rumors, the food quality is still very good, some of the newer cafes on the main campus get rave reviews. Get to work with lots of very smart people, with mostly good attitudes. Very academic atmosphere where research and analysis of data is the preferred way to guide decisions."
Great work Envirnoment and friendly staff.
organization is a great company at the forefront of technological advancement. The pay and hours are good and the work culture is laid back.
"Competitive compensation, work with smart people, bring dogs to work, drink at work (you'll need it)"
"Very creative atmosphere, and the quality of people you work with is noticeably better than anywhere else."
Much of the work at organizations now is dedicated to management and bug fixing. Keep this in mind while considering an organizations position. organizations HR tried to move me to seattle after I signed my offer for a particular team.
A is a Quick company; I could learn a lot; there are quite a lot charming products.
"For most I think the small impact you can make, because there is so much talent there and roles can be narrowly defined."
work with smart people laid back environment learned a lot.
"I was experiencing great fulfillment working for such great Company, using my linguistic skills and Italian culture in a multicultural environment."
"Amazing benefits, co-workers, and insurance. There are opportunities for advancement and ability to travel worldwide."
Hours become long during peak and when leadership staffing is not appropriate for the department.
"nice check, nice PTO . its ok"
Management quality depends on your department/product
Difficult Work but worth the challenge
Excellent first company to join after college. Best launchpad for career.
Extremely competitive; take home pay is not as high as non-organizationrs assume it is; many poorly socialized individuals around.
Commuting to Mt View on the bus
Extremely innovative company and intelligent co workers
"its asteady work, fun environment"
many money and good benefit.
"very agile, short sprints, very small chunks of work at one time, very complex and poorly documented development environment."
Decent pay and benefits for a part-time job.
Opportunities to work with full-time team members on many of the same tasks. Lots of respect from other employees.
Opportunity to grow within the company
"Favoritism in management. If you are not in their ""favorite"" group it makes it kinda hard to move up and from what i've seen people get leadership roles and the position gets to their head quick."
The location was a little inconvenient.
"very fun place to work, lots of smart people"
"Good perks, food, general organization lifestyle"
"depends on team. My team is not a mature team so you kinda lost sometimes. But some of my friends really have a better experience, in their teams."
annoying people hipsterish always wants to talk
"Overall organization is a great company with lots of benefits such as free food, gym, paid internet, cell phone, lots of vacation and free transportation."
"* a place where builders build. I've designed and built some enormous systems, doing difficult tasks."
"Bureaucracy at times like any other companies. Consensus driven culture. Senior management is sometimes managing up rather than down, which can be frustrating"
"Career evolution can be non-existant, so much depends on how good your manager is."
Can be bureaucratic at times due to the large size.
"1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day."
organizations provides a dynamic and agile work environment in a growing industry. Opportunities abound to move around within the company.
very competitive and high stress
There are limited teams in the NY office
Great campus and intern culture
"At organizations, you have the opportunity to work on problems that impact real customers in really big ways! We're at the forefront of multiple industries (devices, cloud computing, ecommerce, and drones to name a few). Every day, you'll be provided opportunities to make decisions that drive forward what customers care about. You'll also be surrounded by the smartest (and often funnest) people of your career.

"Work with really smart, driven people. Product development and managers were top notch. I was able to move around to different teams and global offices every few years -- awesome!"
"senior leadership, career opportunities for senior levels, performance management"
Long walks to and from your work station
"You'll be surrounded by very smart people, which helps your professional growth; compensation & benefits make you feel valued by the company"
Strenuous Work! It like a wet shop and the management is horrible.
Nothing was really wrong. It was great.
"The products are world-class, the company culture is amazing, and the people are some of the smartest people you'll know."
"The hours are long, and the jobs function can become monotonous. The repetition of work that doesn't provide any mental stimulation could be daunting to some. No phones are allowed into the warehouse, which is somewhat understandable."
"Your experience may vary depending on team, manager etc."
"Long hours, some managers leave something to be desired, need a higher starting wage"
"None. I am learning everyday,. Nothing to complain about."
Horrible place to work and management is completely removed from employees. I would not recommend working here.
It's fun you can do whatever you want. I work on !y own schedule so I have a lot of free time
"Awesome perks, I am happy whenever I work on site."
Good pay and Great hours
"not enough work, not worth it"
Working with smart people who were always working to improve things. I also enjoyed being part of a winning team.
Not anything I can think about.
"The extremely high turnover makes it really hard to just DO YOUR JOB, let alone do it extraordinarily well. The lack of depth and breadth of knowledge because most people are new means you get a lot of wrong information/wrong answers, and spend an inordinate amount of time just chasing down basic information to do your job. Lots of time wasted spinning your wheels here, since there is little to no ""institutional memo??Show More"
"Incredibly competitive environment translates into always having to 'watch your back.' Based on my experience, I would say the Engineer culture is very different from the Sales/Business culture. The Sales/Business culture can be stodgy, dry, and incredibly 'corporate.' Training can be very difficult to find at times, which ultimately slows down ramp-up time."
"Company moves fast, so does the employees."
Do not have many opportunities to do something unique
lack of communication
"lack of leadership direction, Lazslo's book is great reading but not all the concepts are really fully practiced at organization"
"Great benefits, work life balance, growth opportunities. Promoted to lead expansion in new geos within 2 years. Fun outings and team building"
great place to work as a fulltime/intern
"Ambiguous environment, not easy to navigate for a lot of ppl"
Complete and powerful tool chain
not family-friendly now that I have kids - I don't wan to spend time playing ping pong and taking advantage of free fun events. I want to get home with my kids.
breaks arent long enough if u r far away from the bigger break room
Great pay and learn a lot.
"Flexible hours, good for job for a self starter."
No work life balance for software engineers
"I can't think of any yet, other than all the cons that go with working for a Big Corporate Machine."
Nothing is wrong with the place great people great work to keep you busy
"There is not much respect for good, task oriented workers. If you do as you are told and not much else you will burn out here quickly. You must also know when to drop things on the floor because the amount of work will always be more than your time."
"A lot of overtime was offered. Learning the job was easy, because nobody minds lending a hand. Friendly work environment."
Hard to get things done sometimes
#NAME?
"Good location, work atmosphere, nice colleagues and team! I learned a lot here. Good work and life balance."
"Too many middle managers with lack of focus, start projects and then quickly abandon them, open discrimination of women, disabled and minorities."
"Although it was overall a positive experience, upward mobility was difficult."
Lot of challenging problems to deal with. Mature infrastructure lets you focus on core problems rather than how o build and deploy
There really aren't too many downsides. Maybe one would be that everyone else there is also smart and it is hard to really stand out as being great.
Too much product for size of building; Management has to scramble to accomodate
"Like any organization, there are internal politics that need to be navigated. Some play this well, some don't. Making sure you align yourself on the right person's good side can be tricky."
Too many people don't know what you do
"low pay, strict culture, unfriendly colleagues"
"The perks are awesome, specifically the gourmet food served for breakfast/lunch/dinner 5 days a week. The luxury shuttles are the most comfortable way to make the commute from SF and the 401K/health/dental plans are top notch. Super smart people and lots of projects going on that are changing the world."
Your experience varies so much based on your team and who your manager is. More training needed for people to actually manage and get the most out of people. Great perks don't make up for the other parts.
organization has the clout and money necessary to provide all the resources necessary to succeed.
"Great benefits and with okay salary for business side as well. Just a little bit down from management consulting firms. Once you are in the organization network, it will be easy for you to find jobs elsewhere too and the connections won't die after you leave."
To thrive you have to be comfortable with uncertainty. Teams are constantly rotating and your job function will constantly evolve.
Very easy warehouse job. organizations really emphasis safety of their employees. My direct leaders are easy to get along with and are not afraid to jump in and help when you're busy.
Long hours 65-70 hrs per week.
"the downs are I!f you don't like to drive, or live in the area, traffic could be a problem!"
"getting very large and a bit bureaucratic, certain parts of the company can be political; less opportunities for people at the director level and up. Certain parts of the business - like Android and Play - have little work / life balance. Little appreciation of marketing in certain businesses that are entrenched monopolies."
"- Learn a lot, haven't been bored yet."
Great place to work and build your career.
matching 401k
Some times e have to use extra time to work
It has good salary. And the environment is good.
Really loyal place to work like a family.
organization has grown big and its hard to find your place.
Lot's of interesting projects to tackle.
"Great perks, smart people, good pay"
No work life balance. Hours do not make the pay worth it.
Very positive experience- excellent management team and team building attitude
Mandatory overtime!! :( also very very monotonous if all you do is pack
All expenses paid trip to organization HQ in Mountain View California
"Everything you've ever heard about working at organization is true. Benefits are awesome, coworkers are awesome, and your work affects millions of people."
"People, perks, energy, and environment."
great entry level job for pay and benefits. Learning dept does a good job teaching and coaching
free snacks
Smart and interesting people. Great culture. Engineers rule. Fun work environment. Pretty open and transparent leadership. Clear career paths that strive to be a meritocracy. Yummy free food and snacks. I enjoyed my time there.
"They fly you out to Mountain View HQ over summer to get trained for a few days. You learn about the organization culture, explore their offices, and have fun with the other Ambassadors. All the Ambassadors stay in a hotel. During the daytime, you have a bunch of workshops at the offices and free food. At night you go back to the hotels and PARTY! Jk, well you can. Oh and everything is ALL EXPENSE PAID!"
I had a fun time do business with and will continue to do so in the future I would recommend it to anyone
"Short breaks, bad HR attitudes"
Too many bosses in one place
"The place smell like mold, the pay isn't enough, they tell you that your full-time and only put you on the schedule 1 or 2 days a week. The management sucks and their very unorganized."
Plenty of opportunity to learn more about organizations and its internal tools
The shuttle schedules were sometimes hard to work around
Great work culture. Driven individuals. Fun place to work.
This is an excellent growth opportunity company.
Pay is very good with the shares and benefits.
"Very relaxed work place. Perks include great free food and drinks basically everywhere you go, and great coworkers. They give interns real projects as well."
"The compensate well, working 4 and sometimes 5 days a week depending on holidays and others"
The work hours is very cool
"The work environment is unpleasant. There are tons of developers crammed into large open spaces. The buildings are completely devoid of personality. There are rows of developers sitting or standing at door desks. It is a very noisy place to try and get work done. You will be constantly interrupted by people pagers going off, cell phones ringing, people talking and gathering around and dogs barking. There are lines to??Show More"
"Shifts could be better scheduled. Currently, the only options are in the evening, starting at either 4 PM, or 9 PM. The 4 PM shift severely limits your options for second jobs, while the 9 PM shift will gradually eat away at your sleep time. A 6 PM shift, for instance, would make the position more viable for a lot of people with other obligations during the day."
Ownership and their leadership principles
"Challenging work, smart co-workers, less politics more work."
Not that I can think of
"Great team, great pay, great hours (always 40 or less), and nice to be around so many smart people."
The commute to Mountain View from San Francisco is horrific. Even if you work with people on the campus you may never see them due to sprawl and traffic.
"Everything is good, infrastructure is the best."
Standing and lifting for 10-12 hours a day.
Not easy to rise up.
Salary is fair. Work is not challenging enough. Experiences vary in different teams. Some teams are good while some teams are not.
"The traffic can get really nasty and the housing prices are just unbelievably high, but the whole bay area has such problems and has nothing to do with the company"
"Well-paid, fun, everyone is friendly, work as much you want and can do, off site visits, it's organization!"
Its gotten too big. Politics and bureacracy have become significant problems.
Awesome place work.
very engaging and creative work
"Great people, lots of perks, awesome benefits, global scope."
Big company (it can be hard to feel you are making a difference for the company).
Packing: If you love to just zone out and do your job it's perfect. All you do is stand in one spot looking at a monitor and boxes and items for 10 - 12 hours a day 4 - 6 days a week.
Always something new to learn.
organization is the most innovative large company that treats their employees well.
Awesome job with lots of advancement.
Fast moving company. Smart people
"Incredibly brilliant people, very comfortable amenities and perks. The opportunity to solve (mostly) really interesting challenges and problems at a HUGE scale."
"To some, the pros are cons."
"Repetitive, easy to get overlooked, high turnover rate"
Not a small company. It's slow to deploy product changes and as a product person you'll spend way more time building consensus and getting approval for launching something than actually building the product.
"very smart people, fascinating innovation, amazing perks"
task become simple over time
On call rotation sucks. Be prepared to have no life outside of work whenever it is your turn to be on call
No cons come to mind
"Located in Detroit, average lifespan for SDE's is very short. 2 years average"
Operations managers don't know what they are doing.
not every implementation of the grand plan can be perfect. not every opening will be filled the way you hope. the energy necessary to perform non-stop for 10-hour work days makes other activities nearly impossible. part-time not available at every location
"There were definite communication issues - at one point one of the managers was very passive-aggressive in communicating a criticism she had of me, which I felt was unnecessary. There were also issues with cohesion among the team - we were divided into two groups (one of which was clearly favored) and not really given a big-picture sense of how our work affected each other (they seemed contradictory but were not, but??Show More"
"Too many leaders and not a lot of leading going on. At my location, some managers are there for the money only. They hide behind successful managers."
Smart people who are passionate about their job.
"Amazing benefits, good pay, extremely intelligent people, engaging work that impacts a lot of people. Managers are competent, and promotion is meritocratic."
"Good Training program, steady work, opportunities for advancement, good benefits"
Great opportunity for growth.
#NAME?
Great work and environment nice location and competitive salary
"Work with some of the smartest and most creative talent around, contribute to a company that makes a significant impact in the daily lives of billions of users, enjoy all the amazing benefits and perks."
"no no cons, nothing negative"
Tons of bureaucracy. Promotions are made unnecessarily difficult.
"Short process, took no longer than 3 days to get the job. Hiring event was pretty quick also, nothing major"
Could become a little bit political around promotion as most big companies. Job mobility can be attained around Mountainview but would be harder in other regions.
"Great culture and people to work with. Had a good time, made great friends. Work is good, sometimes demanding but plenty of flexibility to choose your projects."
"great experience, good opportunities to grow with the company"
"Too busy, a lot of projects."
"Mentally prepare yourself for rigor. There are high expectations for caliber of work. On the upside, learning + development is great because your peers are amazingly talented. On the downside, be ready to be in the middle of the pack."
Hires ex-consultants for operational leadership roles who continue to be consultants than operational leaders (with some exceptions). Not open to leveraging industry best practices and a lot of re-inventions happen for processes that can easily be leveraged from the market. This might be frustrating for folks with significant industry experience.
Management is very young and don't have experience outside of organizations.
You can learn a lot from internal materials if you want to. Great culture.
organization has excellent menu choices. The salary is high for a new grade. They have a very nice working environment.
"Great benefits, some nice people, good opportunities to move up"
Not as giving as some other tech companies.
Tremendous opportunity to learn and develop a deep understanding of how global scale technologies and companies need to work.
Huge level of responsibility and interesting work
"There are a lot of people working at organization, so the quality of your colleagues really varies."
Pay is too little for all the work you have to do. Not enough vacation or paid time off considering you have to work 10 hour shifts so realistically you only will have 8 days off a year when you combine the two together. It's hard to plan out vacations
"Good Pay, Good Benefits, Easy Work, Stock, Tuition Help, Book Reimbursement"
"Upper management doesn't listen to people on the floor, very disorganized, doesn't value high performance employees."
Department heads need more training.
Sometimes loaded with work and extra hours will be required. You must not get behind or you will definitely have to put in extra hours.
If you are hired as an organizationsian you will get a pay check every 2 weeks. If you are a go-getter and can impress the managers you may move up to a Tier 3 associate(PA-Process Assistant) (there is not a tier 2 associate position in the fulfillment DC). They have restricted stocks as a benefit. Once a year they offer cash to those who want to quit organizations. You cannot return if you take the money. People and most of manag??Show More
"Lack of respect from many Area Managers; won't get back to you when they say they will. What they promise you hardly falls through, etc."
"Great culture, it's up to you to make your impact, amazing technology, treat us like adults, food's awesome, total comp is really great (current stock price really helps!)"
Everything is great to work for organization.
Nothing to add here unfortunately
"It's a big company, so you have to work harder to find opportunities to build new things. The nice thing is, the new things you build are built on top of the work of tons of brilliant people, so whatever you end up making will be very specialized and probably pretty awesome."
"it was a lot of hard work, but thats expected"
"Long travel, long hours, everything you would expect"
People management and employee retention is low priority
The base salary is good compared to other companies. life in Seattle is comfortable.
"Free food, good infrastructure, mostly great people, mission, if you can get into a team that actually has a mission. Good pay, though no longer the best. Engineers still (mostly) run things there. It's easy to switch projects if you perform well and opportunities are actually available (which is not a given, especially in remote offices).

Corporate bureaucracy can sometimes be frustrating

"by flexible i mean that you will have to adjust your like to your job, so you will have to be flexible. there schedules are set in stone as well as the over time."
"Work during weekends,nothing particular."
"Good benefits, friendly coworkers, nice paycheck, feels good to have 3 consecutive days off, you are given plenty of time to use, and they do have activities for associates during the summer, and holidays."
"Oh my God, this job is the best kept secret, now mind you I had to drive a little ways to get to the job site because I live in Milwaukee, and the Job is in Kenosha, but its well worth it, the pay is great and the energy is so high, you get to wear jeans, a t shirt and tennis shoes, there's a lot of walking so you get a full work out, so if you like to stay in shape, this is the place, you get paid every Friday, my d??Show More"

That's the most common situation I've seen where someone didn't do well at organizations. Saying ""no"", prioritizing and dropping things on the floor when needed is a crucial skill. As I mentioned in my pro section, we often have 1 person doing the job a whole team really should be doing. So you're going to have to figure??Show More"
Unreasonably low pay. organizations needs to up its game or find themselves sharing the spotlight with Walmart and McDonalds pay reputation.
The location for the company is in downtown which brings inconvenience.
"I never had problems there, salary was good not exceptional"
Politics influence your rating and promotion
"Fun working environment, challenging, lots of people to interact with, lots of overtime bumps your pay way higher than the estimated (up to $25,000+ a year), typically get 3 day weekend unless it's the holiday season."
Very good quality products and usually arrives on time and when it doesn't they refund your money no questions asked
"too many people, imposter-syndrome inducing, no symmetry is prohect complexity among interns on different teams, it's organization!"
metrics to keep up with
"Decent hours for part time. Pay is pretty good for the work. Not slave labor, nor are you treated like a slave. Very lenient on many things."
"too much work, lot of pressure"
"Back-Stabbing Work Culture, Lack of Respect and Value for Experienced Hires-Subject Experts Mostly Generalists, Rewards ""See What Sticks"" mentality"
Constant change
Hiring can be a mess and take forever. There's a lot of either deprecated technology in the stack or tech that is not ready to use.
Lots of management turnover and the managers are often young graduates who are not seasoned so it takes a long time for things to gel.
Great learning opportunity for interns
Had a great time. My internship was incredible. I worked on tough problems and learned a lot of new technologies over 3 months.
"Good pay, good people, good job."
"Good food, good people, good position and good techniques."
"food, intelligent people, great access to resource and mentors"
High Turnover rate
This is not a place to coast - come ready to make a difference.
Smart people and challenging projects
"over rated, boring, hierarchical, political"
"Lots of management overhead, does move slowly, especially on the engineering side, which means you sometimes have to sit on your hands. Also there's a decent amount of back and forth from middle management on direction."
"Works with your school schedule, benefits start immediately, flexible paid time off and decent pay."
Becoming a large corporation with the usual challenges
It's seasonal so it's not very long.
"The main issue now is that they have hired so many people that there are not too many hours available,"
Terrible place to commute to if you want to live in San Francisco
Best benefits I have had working for any company. organizations will not let you work more then 60 hr in a week they believe in a healthy home life.
Great People. Great Culture. Great Benefits.
"everything, management is bad, pay is bad, and the work sucks."
"Good money, good people, good food. Everyone I've worked with at organization has been a pleasure to work with."
"Pretty competitive, lack of opportunities for full-time as a contractor"
"there are no pros to working for organizations, besides good insurance."
Its a fun place to work
"Lots of accomplished and diverse engineers around you, best practices are very refined, mentorship and sense of community between teams and buildings is very strong if you are willing to participate!"
Good company ever...i recomment to any one who is currently looking for there good job.
Good team members to work with. I love the offices and we are working on great projects that will build up my CV. RSUs are great as well and make up for the bonus.
Great place to work/perks/culture/fun/learning and very smart ambitious people to work with. Great name on your resume
"Decent pay considering there aren't really any prerequisites for the job. Some positions will even pay for a minimum number of hours per week, so you'll still get a decent check on slow weeks."
"It's hard work, but still nothing to extreme."
"good pay, perks"
"support, perks, culture, team, learning opportunities"
Can be very stressful at first and work/life balance can be difficult (depending on the team).
temps in and out. peak season...too many people
1. Work with smart people in a great company
I can not think of anything
You're feet will kill you and becoming a regular employee there is difficult
1. Not too high salary
Fix computer and having better service
"Work life balance was sometimes out of whack. Holidays could be very demanding, but everyone understood that we needed to meet customer demand."
"hours varied, upper management can be tricky"
Short breaks. At least as a part time worker.
Getting to work for organization. Great culture outside of the ITRP program.
"The traffic can get really nasty and the housing prices are just unbelievably high, but the whole bay area has such problems and has nothing to do with the company"
Not enough holidays & vacation days
"Good opportunities, mobility, good reward"
Great chances for promotions. The company is growing fast year after year. You can get a promotion every year. You work hard but play hard as well. They take good care of each other.
lots of new projects and good team to work with..
"chance to get to know new work activites and people,lack of opportunity for promotion,no chance diversity"
"* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of xyz's internal tension)."
When promotions become available management already has certain people in mind.
Sometimes the work-life balance is not that good; the company is too huge.
"free food, massages, co workers and environment"
"Free meals; Easy going, laid back work environment."
"Work life balance, pressure to be the best creates a very competitive environment as well as tearing down those around you in an attempt to look better than your peers."

"Lots of innovation, exciting projects, very smart people to collaborate with, mostly good work/life balance"

WLB in a lot of marketing teams is a myth
None. Work is work. Every job is going to ask you to work hard and I love that this is a value here. It's important.
"Good hours, decent pay, work from home, Great managers"
Internal politics sometimes prevents you from growth
You're a small fish in a big pond. Easy for some people to coast and get lost in the crowd. The work you are doing likely has very little impact on the overall company.
"Flexible working environment, new technology"
"Some organizationrs are incredibly entitled and complain about mundane issues. It's less nimble than it used to be. Certain organizations (People Operations) are bureaucratic and very top-down in leadership style, which is antithetical to the way organization portrays itself."
Mandatory seven day work schedule. Expect managers to be connected to their phone and internet. HR tolerates this behavior and has no backbone to prevent seven day work schedules as accepted norm.

Nothing to say in here.

Slow growth in terms of promotions.
no feedback to give. super good workplace
"Working as a PM at organizations gives me the opportunity to dream up the future, and then actually build it. It's like having the best-funded startup ever."
The differential between regular associate to process guides (floor supervisors) was at the time .25 cents. On your feet possibly standing in one spot for hours. The pay could be better.

I don't really have cons.
boring phone calls that last long

Goog knowledge of electrical feed for telecomunications
organization is as advertised - it's an amazing place to work full of incredibly smart people working on interesting and challenging problems. The pay and perks are great. In theory there is a lot of opportunity for mobility and organization does seem committed to developing people over the course of their careers.

I didn't have any thing to say.

"Friendly and competitive environment,unlimited food and perks.I have worked for organization more than 3 years and always felt this place like my second home."
Had a lot of fun at this job. Was really cool to be working for organization. Would recomend.
Can help improve managerial experience
"It's mentally and physically draining , you spend a lot of time alone and you're required to work extremely hard"
"Working for a company that has massive scale, reach, and a positive influence on people every day. Transparency from the very top down. Opportunities to work with brilliant minds."

Ability to switch between multiple groups. Never gets boring.
It is easy to more up in this company.
"you get paid well, meet well people, and get to work as hard as you please ( for all the workaholics)."
Pushing people to their limits on speed for numbers has its downside. People get fatigued and frustrated when pushed in this fashion.
The work can be somewhat monotonous and transactional depending on your specialization
"Good pay, good benefits. You get to work with some of the smartest, most capable people, on the most interesting problems. There are almost unlimited opportunities within the company."

Hard to get things done sometimes
"No reimburse for gas or tolls, they can mess up your hours and you need to make sure that they tell you about your tips because sometimes they don't."
"You can end up feeling like an extremely minuscule part of the company, because the company is so large. I was definitely lucky and got a team that was top-notch and extremely welcoming to interns, but others might not be so fortunate. While my team dynamic was great, some other interns had less ideal experiences. Being at this internship can definitely spoil you for other places."
Great cultural values that makes you think about how to run the company from the management perspective. One of the best companies to develop your career and to develop strong work ethic. Lot's of former ex-organizationsians have come back.

"organizations success depends heavily on upper management, it all depends on who your senior managers are. I came from another building and went to TPA2 who has horrible senior leadership. Promotions are not based on who has the best shift or process improvement, but instead the process is subjective and is a popularity contest. TPA2 has a lot of senior managers who are friends with their direct reports who soon get promoti??Show More"
"The actual work... it will probably suck. Don't be fooled. You will probably get told very little about your role before you start. Then you will spend a lot of time ramping up in your job, drinking from a hose, and one Sunday evening discover that the fit is bad and dread Monday morning. All you can do is suck it up, smile, find the good in your job or try to find a new role. Good luck with finding a new job in Goog… Show More"
Busy busy busy very busy
"Standing basically in the same spot for 9 1/2 hours and the reptition using your hands, you start to notice carpa ltunnel aches that last for days."
"The pay is great, the benefits are second to none. Dev hardware is insane, production resources are seemingly unlimited."
It is too boring to work there.
Because I will create helpful tools to use
"Amazing culture, smart people, great career opportunities, free food, benefits"
"salary, benefits, flexibility, culture, transparency"
"Good Leadership, plenty of opportunities for advancement"
Amazing people an great opportunities
"Long shifts, must meet rate, breaks and lunches too short."
Challenging work.
Brilliant people to work with and fantastic culture
Most amazing and innovative company on the planet
"Easy to work with schedule, Friendly Managers, Relatively Stress Free Work Load, Offer A Great Deal Of Perks To Employees During Thee Holiday Season."
"You never feel valued. Burnout, and poor management is prevalent. In an environment where folks are compensated for individual contributions, not building teams or working together, there is little recognition for Managers that care for or develop their teams. Good people are forced out of the Company daily due to the rating requirement to force out 10% of the workforce. The compensation does not reward your contribu??Show More"
All employees are not held to the same standards. A lot of favoritism at every level. Stated Company standards not applied.
Benefits are amazing.
"Great colleagues, competitive pay, industry leading benefits, nimble for a large company. The company is pursuing very lofty goals and really leading the industry on a number of fronts. After 8 years, organization is still a great place to work and I can't imagine working for any other company. The only thing that could pull me away would be to start my own venture."
After a few hours you go crazy doing the same thing over and over again but after your first two weeks you'll get used to it.
Long hours
Very easy work to do
"Awesome hours and had to cover multiple locations. Nice perks, but could always be better."
None that I can think of.
Be ready to take on the shortcomings of a multi billion dollar company.
Limited upward mobility in remote offices.
"In general: a lot of people are slacking at the moment. They don't really care about what they're doing. Company lacks proper processes, accountability, and avoids conflict to the point that it languishes dangerously."
"Very productive learning experience, and great company to start your career"
can not think of any
Slow upward mobility and Leadership
Good place to work for young people
"Culture, compensation & benefit, management, products."
Flexible Hours - I can start my day when ever I want.
amazing company to work for
Great experience! learned a lot with a lot of activities!
Poor internal promotions. People from the outside coming in will make more than someone that already knows the job.
very good work culture at organizations
4 day work week. Good pay and benefits. Energetic atmosphere. Ability to see and familiarize yourself with many many products
"Challenging work environment, huge opportunity for growth, competitive pay, and great benefits. If you like seeing results and being recognized as the worldwide leader in operations, supply chain mgmt, and working for a Fortune 50 company like organizations, then this is the perfect opportunity for you."
"Great perks (food, gym, etc). Opportunities to transfer roles, transfer internationally etc. Respectful managers & team members."
The expectations of performance can be brutal. The retention rate is terrible. They expect you to do it one way to achieve quality but your speed will suffer for it. In the end it is all about the speed. Also expect to work 60hrs of over time during peak season. (Nov-Dec)
"Very crowded campuses, easy to feel lost in a sea of employees. Free food, but nowhere to sit down and eat it. Not always easy to spend time on ""20 percent time"" projects as advertised. Lots of internal bureaucracy, surveys, and distractions of optional employee-oriented programs. Self-promotion is encouraged, so prepare to toot your own horn and compete for recognition of your project if you want to get promoted"
"Lots of opportunities to learn and move around. Some really awesome people, the downside of which is, they don't stay at organizations."
Expensive area to live in
"Long hours, a constant emphasis on performing tasks more quickly and more efficiently. A general impression of being a cog in a giant machine that management would replace with an actual machine if possible."
Managers won't assign SDEI's interesting work.
"The intense pressure can be overwhelming, so expect to see a lot turnover. It's hard to remain motivated at times if you feel that you're falling behind."
Good people. great work environment.
"Free food, nice environment, decent salary, good company reputation, and a lot more great things."
Good pay and fun people
Easy hire process/decent pay
It's big... really big
Challenging environment full of smart people
"Amazing management, perks, food, fun, coworkers, atmosphere, it was just a wonderful place to work."
Great place to work love it
"Pay was good, benefits from day one, meet a lot of new people, a lot of fun contests, and great giveaways. They keep you hydrated with the endless water supply"
Changing the way things are done takes hard work and lots of time. Burnout is common but not a sign of weakness.
"HUGE bureaucracy, with a company this big there is specialized roles and process for everything. Definitely not an ""intimate"" community and can take forever to get approvals for what seems the smallest thing."
"Great opportunities for go getters who are willing to put in a lot of energy. Can learn good practices, which will be useful beyond. Good for young folks."
Too many great people. Too many debates on the scope of the product.
Training program is not sufficient to meet the companies demands and expectations
sometimes people come to organization and think they're better than everyone else and that's not the spirit of organization. sometimes people get self entitled and it stinks
"fast paced environment; the pressure to perform, and always perform is across the company hierarchy;"
"No work life balance, no structure or organization. Everyone wants to move up quickly so it creates a hostile work environment. The amount of hours you work isn't worth the money."
Open culture; fast moving; dynamic; ambitious; lots of perks; strong culture
Good atmosphere and diverse workforce at the entry level
Becoming more conventional as size grows with a limited scope of what one can do.
"You will be working with very talented and smart people. People are not afraid to throw out all of their ideas, which makes design meetings and teamwork fun and challenging."
"Flexible, lots of opportunities, good environment."
"You have to be a go getter. Don't expect much structure, or you might struggle. You may miss out on some industry standard terminology in certain roles. There's an ""organizations way""."
"Good hours, nice pay and lots of people to meet. Great benefits and awesome staff."
Long time for a hiring decision for MBA full-time and intern roles.
"* organization has, bar none, some of the best office schemes I've ever seen. Their conference room layouts make a lot of sense, and the designs and liveliness pouring through those walls were on another level."
"They give a lot of hours, simple task and a lot overtimes."
Horrible systems
Bad work life balance if you have a family
Will hire anyone and you can walk around all day
organization is a good place to work with free food and great perks. the 20% time to work on own projects is a bit blown though
"cohesiveness of the teams, good managers and strong work ethics of all Facilities Techs"
"Great company, lots of interesting work, great coworkers, upward mobility."
"-99% of the people you work with are brilliant, but are also not jerks"
"Culture has a noticeable focus on being nice to one another, get to work on exciting things"
projects can easily be shut down
"Amazing team mates, great perks. Very fair in all processes"
"Good salary, good health insurance , working with smart people, work closely with customers"
High visibility/impact.
A good place to learn cloud computing and distributed systems.
Excellent food and the location is good for many activities.
"Great company , lots of benifits, would not change working here for anything, they are doing alot of hiring. Many locations throughout the country. Constantly hiring"
"Great work life balance, amazing perks, smart and ambitious co-workers. Great lateral mobility opportunities at the company. Food is amazing too."
tough but lots of great vibes
"It's organization. You work with smart people, work on interesting projects, and have fantastic perks. Work life balance was surprisingly good."
"large complex systems, enterprise java, good salaries, flexible work hours"
"Being on a good team is very important. However, it seems moderately easy to switch teams of that option ever comes up."
There are lots of different internal systems which you can build things upon. But the learning curve is steep - take a long time to ramp up.
I worked 40 hours a week until peek hit. Then my hours were up to 55 a week.
-it's already big so it's difficult to contribute a large amount as a lower level person
"They offered a lot of overtime, you can work from home"
I second the person who said organization protects bad managers. It seems like the more talented people leave and the less talented people get promoted (it's more about politics than talent).
- Free Food!
the company has great perks and snacks
"The people are intelligent and down to earth, you get a lot of exposure, and are able to make decisions that affect millions of customers"
organizations is a great company. They are very good with benefits and stock bonuses.
"Operations team creates a lot of issues that could be avoided, creates work for us that is time wasted, should be spent improving and developing equipment and processes to make the facilities more profitable."
Peak season could be rough sometimes and dealing with certain associates might be hard.
Operational load can be very high for some teams. Competitive environment.
This company is going the big wigs way. The 20% time to work on own projects is over blown and you really dont get this much time.
organization is far from being a startup and it slowly becomes more and more corporate. Selecting a team and evaluating its culture before joining becomes more important to make sure your expectations match your team's.
"organizations's a company that has been (an will be) in hyper growth mode. We believe in being flat and decentralized with employees expected to use high judgment (instead of complex policies). There are growing pains for any company/team growing like this. We hold our core values at the nucleus of business (which is great), but there are challenges in growing this quickly."
"Food, laundry, gym, bikes... Free? Fun and challenging"
"Sales / business side is becoming political, zero sum game and bureaucratic."
Great place to be great job
Burnout is real
"Flexible hours, awesome benefits, amazing coworkers!"
Physically demanding.Daily Rates/goals. Timeoff takes a while to accrue your first year. Long hours on your feet...shifts are ten hours plus.Management/staff have high turnover.
Money is the best part
Not too intense. Lots of outdoor activities during. The people are nice. Everyone is assigned a mentor. The salary was good as well.
"Long, grueling hours in the summer (especially with no air conditioning), but nothing really to complain about as far as the management or how employees are treated."
Management is poorly selected below operations tier 5 AKA any one with leadership on there vest this includes HR.
"long hours, no bonuses paid, i have a long commute. I am traveling a lot too from Seattle to the bay."
"A lot of long hours year round for HR. Operations has it's peak season during the holidays, but HR's peak season is year round"
Relaxing work environment.
#NAME?
There wasnt really any cons that I can talk about It was overall a great experience and im glad I got to be apart of it.
Give lots of unpaid time
The long hours of standing and walking each night can be tiresome.
great work environment
"(1) Countless perks that probably adds 20% to your base salary (including free food, transportation, gym, dance/sports classes, etc)"
Independent working ethics for staff
"Thankless, lack of development, no work/life balance"
No differential in pay if you work in different departments.
#NAME?
Great benefits and friendly people. Never had a terrible day here.
organization is probably the best corporate environment to work in. A lot of opportunities to get exposed to things outside of your immediate job. Strong brand allows you to open many doors. Of course the perks have
#NAME?
"If your not in seattle, you get 0 benefits. Even when your in seattle is pretty lame on what they give back for employees."
"Great work-life balance. Very friendly and cooperative colleagues, partly due to the way we hand out promotions. Internally rather transparent and management seems to listen to what we want."
lots of over time.. make great money
"1) Inexperienced and bloated middle management. 2) The white badge vs red badge situation creates conflict within departments. In this employment model, an employee sits next to a contractor, both do the exact same work but the employee gets paid 2x as much and has a full benefits packages."
Great work conditions and good atmosphere also really nice benefits. Also the work space is really nice and love the free food
Long hours standing on feet constantly
"big company, need to learn skills to deal with it."
"organization's hiring process is a bear, which made it very difficult as a recruiter. Making meaningful and non-trivial suggestions often fell on deaf ears."
Great company to continue your education
"Chances of advancement are very slim, management is hit-or-miss."
"Transfer opportunities all over the country and the world, medical, dental, vision and life insurance, 401k match."
1. Limited impact.
Free food but not great. Perks are not easy to understand.
"Colleagues are smart, motivated, and nice. They keep me coming back. Vacation policy is pretty generous for US."
"They do have great benefits, health,vision,dental 401 k and stock options, love my schedule."
Great company culture and benefits
it is a great place to work
"Mountain View-centric attitude leads to extreme commute times. This is the largest negative about working here, and I probably would have left by now if I wasn't able to work from home or the SF office most of the week. I'm sure if you live in boring suburbia it'd be fine, but I don't want to do that."
Like most retail jobs the hours can be very long. Especially during the holiday season.
Work gets redundant and boring sometimes.
Work/Life due to extreme customer focus
Customers live the service. Tips are tremendous. You are paid $18 per hour plus tips.
"high salary, good insurance and benefits"
"organization deserves every bit of its ""Best Company to Work For"" reputation. My own experience was in getting to build a business from scratch inside the company and watching it flourish."
"I joined organizations after completing my MBA from a top 5 program. In my opinion, organizations provides the best possible environment for mid-career development."
"Decent high velocity place to work, not the most employee friendly company though."
organization is now a large company so there's a fair amount of bureaucracy and processes in place which can slow things down. Promotions are harder to come by but this is natural for any company of this size. organization is heavily email-centric and so you better be ready for 200+ emails a day and sometimes an implicit expectation to be on email during off-hours.
"repediative work , 10 hour days"
"Some workers are unprofessional and the management fosters them. Very click atmosphere without allowing people growth. Constant unprofessional activities occurring and the management allows and participates, encouraging turnover. No hr assistance."
Great benefits. Safe work environment.
"Less coding , more operational work , less challenging"
The pros at organizations are that you will never find yourself bored and wondering what you could be doing. The work is always plentiful and provides challenges to work through.
"Good food. Good co-workers, Opportunities to leave the comapny"
Great experience working this job
Have to spend a minimum of one year in a role before a promotion
"A need to improve muy english level , but i have the necessary level to work."
"Difficult to keep a work life balance and not for everyone. If you cannot stay at a high pace and high expectations, it is not a good place for you."
Is perfect it doesn't have any negative
"After recent restructuring it will be difficult for people in the Alphabet companies to move about between projects, which will limit future opportunities. The interview process makes it difficult for good people to come in, outside of being acquired."
This is a work from home position. Fast paced and high volume call activity. There is ample opportunity for overtime.
#NAME?
Great to stay in organization with open atmosphere
Lack of communication don't say we'll get off one time then keep the belt rollin past the time and expect people to stay
Need better communication between engineering and other departments/teams
"HR employees are rarely on site, for assistance,"
"Great Benefits, Good Perks, Smart Co-workers"
Great atmosphere and the schedule is very flexible
"Great coworkers, lots of opportunities"
Limited career opportunities given size of company.
"Rapid growth potential, Hands-on leadership experience, clear culture and corporate values"
"exciting, awesome, critical thinking, i really like it"
"Super smart people, engineering culture."
"I really enjoy working with my current team! organization, as everyone know, is a very innovative place and people thrive to invent new thing every day! I am glad to be part of the such successful company."
"I guess I didn't drink the Kool-Aid. organization has been a major success story in building the web into what it is today. However, most of the management and employees have fallen in love with their own intelligence. This is very bad news for the future growth of the company. Additionally, organization is very risk adverse no matter that they have a ""moonshot"" factory. They don't stick to their goals when there are set backs."
no cons as it is good company
Company has grown to be large
Miscommunication of work schedule and overtime days.
"Tales of terrible work-life balance are exaggerated, tales of lavish benefits are not. 9-5 or 10-6 are pretty standard working hours, although some choose to work longer."
You learn a lot of new things and it's a fun place to work.
"Security. organization is a safe bet. Innovation is paced though, as with any developed company. All my time was spent in organization for Work org, which was very different from greater organization and had poor leadership. Was inconsequential enough that greater organization hadn't yet taken notice, but I predict a big shake up soon."
Dont care about emploies period. Bottom line is the ONLY THING THET MATTERS!!!!! tHhe turn over rate is probably thre highest any where
Nothing
The insurance benefits were great.
Pay is great if you overlook the complete lack of work/life balance; opportunity for advancement within the company - good luck promoting out of this building. Sr management will go behind your back to stop you from moving to another building
"Spacious, personal and vaction time give"
Company is very very big
"Too large company, and you have to learn quickly"
Some of the best perks in the industry.
meet a lot of fresh faces.
"Working hard can include long hours, weekends, accommodating global timezones and other difficulties. This is not a 9-5 company. Moving up can be incredibly slow."
"10 hour shifts on your feet, half hour lunch"
Unorganized
"Great company to work for if you're tech oriented. The interview process was a bit thorough, but necessary, The pay was solid and I moved up within 6 months. Overall a positive employment experience."
Super awesome place I need one more word.
Long commute and turning into a very large organizaiton
It can be really stressful dealing with upset customers.
It does get boring sometimes doing the same thing over and over again and it takes a long time to get things done.
walking 10 miles a day
"Complete lack of accountability for some managers - drunk driving charges, inappropriate relationships with subordinates, leaving work to have drinks and then returning to work, sexist remarks in the workplace. The facility where I worked has a Senior Leadership team who have no idea how to lead. They try to motivate through fear, belittlement, and intimidation. They have no concept of how to develop or train."
"Lots of hours, 4 day work week (unless you have to work overtime) good benefits"
Management has no backbone and will not support you. Everyone fears HR
Amazing perks and benefits
Multiple opportunities for growth
High expectations and intense workload
"Got to meet some decent people from jersey, when it's a little warmer out its nice ride from philly to jersey"
"Physical labor, can get very tiring work"
If is full time could be perfect
Rates you on performance daily
I don't really have any cons! Maybe the only con was that the food is too good and too plentiful so I gained about 7 lbs during my internship :(
The actual job is very monotonous and very physical. The regular schedule is 4 consecutive 10 hour days and a fifth overtime day if needed. Pickers walk an average of 12 to 15 miles a day and at the end of a ten hour work day you go home completely drained.
"Great perks, strong team in NYC"
it has a lot of people working on a lot of projects so it's hard to make a decision
you get a great pay and it helps you out with getting other cleaning jobs
"Frugality - though this is one of organizations's Leadership Principles I think it is because of this employees compare perks, benefits and simple things like working lunch meets and put the company in negative light."
"The best strategy is to enter organizations as a new hire MBA, build your skills with different industry leading products and technologies, and move on by year 4. For experienced hires, your ability to advance in your career is 100% dependent on the networking skills of your manager, their experience with the process, and the quality of their writing due to a highly political, subjective promotion process. There are no defi??Show More"
"There are not that many women working at organization or in leadership positions there. This negatively affects the team dynamics, for both men and women. Women reading this - apply! Aim high! You can do it!"
Awesome place that is doing some incredible things. I love working here. Work hard have fun and make history is really what they ask of you.
"Cutthroat management tactics, hiring management from outside prior to posting positions internally."
they truly care about their employees.
"There were a lot of perks, everyone raves about the breakfast, lunch and dinner. I guess it really helps with your productivity"
Will burn you out. Gives whatever you are willing to sacrifice.
cant say anything of that kind
The training which is done among ambassadors is not uniform nor is it to the standards of the floor supervisors who will be supervising you. So be warned you will be critiqued you will be written up be sure you stay at the front of the group so you receive your instruction loud and clear! It is better to have incorrect technique than to be clueless altogether about your job.
"Competitive, too many people trying to become a manager. Too high bar to get promoted."
I felt like the company was truly invested in me (and my professional development) and that the people around me genuinely appreciated my contributions.
Good rotation program after mba school. Some group may be demanding but you have lots to learn and improve.
Upper management tends to micromanage and they keep adding responsibilities to job expectations. Proper training is generally not provided.
"At some point, decision making became too ""top-down"", which made it hard to stay engaged to products."
"Opportunities to move up, may help with education."
organization was a great company to work.
"Intellectual environment, fast paced and ambitious."
The pay is pretty decent
The hours and the pay has been worth it.
"large company, commute, spoiled me"
Amazing people to work with and learn from.
"Free, heathy food offerings, good benefits package"
Working with intelligent and innovative people.
Dont want to leave some days
"dangerous, zero growth, time away from home, no benefits"
So much fun. Great people
"Huge Impact, lots of interesting people you work with, people get excited every time you mention you work there. Overall though I really enjoyed working there and would recommend."
"Good place to work, but long hours"
I'm a loyal worker.
I struggled with finding ways to progress my career and change verticals.
"organization has amazing benefits and perks, a lively social atmosphere, and some of the most talented and bright sales people you'll meet"
I learn a lot. organization pays for my Masters degree at Stanford.
Flex time and once you leave work your day is done.
You get to work on a ton of stuff and use the latest AWS technologies and learn how one of the biggest software companies in the world manages its software processes
"Still have politics. The company is large, so some things don't get done as quickly. Some overachievers are trying very hard to shine. If you are aggressive and try to climb the corporate ladder than the competition can be tough."
Things change so quickly that it can be difficult to figure out the right way to get something done. Tools get deprecated so quickly that it's a constant race to make sure valuable tools continue to get updated and work. Growing fast so office space is really becoming an issue.
"Rare chance to move up, the area managers are all new hires from Virginia Tech and they come in not knowing absolutely zero. Jobs go up on the job board just long enough for the person they want to have to put in their application.(less than 24 hours)"
Company was very involved with making the work environment a better place.
Not too many career advance opportunities.
Great place to work. Very fast paced environment.
Lots of potential for learning on exciting projects
"organization has great amenities. You get free food, massages, gym. Great snacks and drinks. Friendly and smart co workers. More recruiters contact you."
"Constant travel, devices shut down sometimes"
Great people to work with.
"good experience, good people, good atmosphere, loved my co-workers, can be fun"
organization has a very flexible culture. You can benefits from learning experience from other geeks.
"Working in Customer Service has many areas for specialization; retail, Prime Now, organizations Logistics, to name a few. There are multiple helpful resources to find answers to problems. There are always new projects developing. Frequent overtime opportunities. Individuals can make exceptions to policies when it's in the customers best interest."
"perks, food, gym, culture, love, food, massage, location, fun, beers, events, working with young people and people that are smart"
I don'l like working third shift.
"Great co-workers, managers and projects."
Freedom for self-motivated people to succeed. Upper management values ideas from individuals. Highly qualified and motivated co-workers. Best place to work.
Bureaucracy
"organizations offers an opportunity to excel in an ever-changing, fast paced environment. Benefits including full medical, dental, vision as well as tuition assistance (95% paid upfront). My experience at organizations has been noting short of fantastic. I have been able to excel and advance in one of the most competitive environments I have ever known."
learned a lot and nice work experience
None at all. Can get difficult at times with middle management
"Great minds, many opportunities, challenging work."
Great if you have no brains and like following rules.
Great pay. Great people. Great.
"They will lie to recruit you, and promise training, ops roations, and learning opportunities that never happen."
"Not in San Francisco, traffic getting worse, sometimes too focused internally"
"Committed customer centricity, bright people"
They don't really value their employees
"Work/life balance, Pager duty, Seattle Weather"
"Super smart people, lots of free stuff. Amazing to work at organization, just to realize it's not all that."
There are no major complaints.
They often hire from within and there seem to be a lot of opportunities to move up. They also have fantastic benefits
Flexible Schedule to work around school or another job. Decent pay considering the ease of the work.
Great brand to have on the resume. The company is doing some very interesting projects. Opportunities to transfer across division is a great benefit.
"Benefits (Medical, Dental, Vision, 401K, Stock), PTO (Paid time off), VTO/VTO(Vacation Time off & Voluntary Time off) UPT (Unpaid time off). When working here pregnant, it's a breeze until it's time leave 4 weeks before your delivery date. You get paid to sit down and chill (if your an advent reader, it's a good time to use work as your own personal library) Only good for if your desperate in getting a job."
"Pager duty, too much operational work, too much oncall tasks. The annual review process makes for a competitive environment in which you will be pitted against your peers in your own team."
Got fired hr did nothing to fight for my rights
"Sales team is big and bureaucratic, not startup-like at all. Hard to get out of sales onto other teams. Very few opportunities in Boston due to it being a remote office."
"Great benefits! Healthcare,dental,vision, 401k,monthly peformance/attendance bonuses,. Opportunities for advancement and overtime! Lots of extra perks!"
Working at organizations is great during peak season. It was a great experience because of the diversity there was.
"Good Salary and benefits and emerging technology that gives good work experience. Work environment is good, and there are some employee discount perks."
organization is a huge company. Sometimes feels like you get lost in what you're doing. Great company but definitely feels big.
I don't have anything negative to say
Lack of opportunities out of one division or another.
work life balance is not good
Great benefits and good pay
"Great place to start a career or work for a while. You learn a ton of best practices, work in the great company which is organization, enjoy all of the amazing organization benefits, and get to work with awesome people. Also, it's a wonderful brand to be associated with, and you constantly learn innovative ideas and mindsets (especially if you go to TGIF)."
"A lot to learn for a college graduate, including but not limited to: coding, design, operation, continuous deployment, all kinds of best practices."
"Amazing benefits, especially insurance and maternity leave"
"Autonomy, Customer Focused, Innovative Culture"
"I love the earning potential and the perks are amazing! Set schedule, tons of overtime, amazing benifits... 401k, medical, dental, vision, meds effective the day of orientation... tuition assistance after only 1 year of full time employment, Paid Time Off, Unpaid Time Off, and Vacation Time... cumultive from day one!"
Do not depend on getting full-time during off-peak season.
"Can be cloistered, ivory tower"
You will learn more here than anywhere else you've worked.
Communication between team members out side of the weekly team meeting had no consistency.Team is separated into focus areas specialized for each member and the overall team which can have constraints for those who are not self thought or self starters. Team may feel distant at times if it's divided by offices. Expect to hit the workload at light speed while making sure you are ALWAYS on top of everything so that it'… Show More
Hard work but it has been described as paid exercise.
"The basics, free food, good benefits (but now most tech companies have the same benefits), a lot of good people."
"High energy, fast-paced environment. Motivated and driven leadership. Streamlined fulfillment strategy."
"smart hard working employees, some departments manage to mitigate the giant company culture"
organizations can be a bruising environment for those that are not used to having their ideas challenged. This criticality is not always a bad thing but this idea of questioning everything often causes more problems than it solves.
A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at organization. Do a TON of research on the role you'll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you'll be doing to try and prepare for what's to come.
"They give everyone a chance. They don't discriminate based on age, race or gender. Lots of opportunity get overtime especially during the holidays. Lots of Unpaid time off"
They offer good pay and benefits
Learn a lot of new things
Great opportunities with a big company
"- Commute: 1.5 hours is alleviated by riding on the shuttle, but it is still 1.5 hrs."
Has a good track record with inventory and shipping abilitys.
Opportunity takes time up to two plus years!
"Strong culture, lots of really smart people from whom you can learn a lot. Great resources, every aspect of company is innovative and doesn't settle for OK. Fun environment."

"The area manager job is seen by most in the FC as the most difficult job at the entire company. Work/Life balance is extremely challenging. During Peak, there is none. You will work over 60 hours per week at a minimum, sometimes up to 70. For 2 months straight the alarm clock was going off at 330am to make it in to work a 13 to 14 hour day, 5 days per week.

Less ambitious people get marginalized.
Salary compensation was unsatisfying and inadequate for the high quality professional performances provided.

"Good working environment, Good company culture, Good salary and bonus...Overall, right choice to work here!"
Work life balance can be an issue.
"They have interesting technology. The food is nice. You will probably like your colleagues. There is a lot of smart, driven people here. You will be recruited from other companies pretty heavily."
There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (organization Project Shield).
"Management is hit and miss, there are lots of organizational restructures in the sales/marketing teams and it can feel chaotic, many of the pain points you'd expect working for a big corporation"

"Great people, great management, great benefits! Many opportunities for advancement."
Look forward to long hours during Peak season

there were no cons ! great job!
"FIRST OFF, organizations will lie to your face and make you feel like part of their company. The first hint of how awful this company is that they make you sign a waiver so that you cannot sue them on your first day!

It's impressive how much responsibility and opportunity you're given compared to comparable career levels at other companies. That are lots of big projects. I've had the opportunity to launch new devices and entirely new online retail shopping experiences internationally.

Amazing place to work - great people and great benefits
Weak HR most of the working time no one at office .
cons are that there are absolutely no cons but organization is life and without it we wouldnt be alive today so thank you organization and everything you do. you are life.
Most people who are promoted to a Process Assistant (PA)(Tier 3) are pre picked before the applications are filled out and interviews are finished. The managers encourage everyone to apply and schedule an interview.

too many recruiters stepping over everyone's toes
Long hours! 10 hour shifts. Very boring depending on what your job is. No music or phones allowed. Very strict on lunches and breaks. Management is HORRIBLE at communicating with other managers or supervisors. This makes any projects very frustrating for everyone. organizations will hire a college student straight out of school with NO experience in warehousing and place him as manager.
"work-life balance, perks/benefits, impactful work, job security"
I was able to move up within 7 months and get into human resources. Getting into human resources has helped me get a better look at what a true career is.

Schedules can be grueling around big releases and winter holidays due to the nature of the retail business.
"Free food, great campus, great space, great people, unlimited resources, always something to do"
terrible working environment in the warehouse. people were miserable and it showed. management frequently neglected the needs of its workers.
"The company insists on their employees manage their work/life balance but while they encourage employees on one hand, in order to succeed in your position, you need to remove ""life"" from that equation. Also, the NY Times article was correct in many areas, especially back-stabbing. While the company doesn't promote that type of activity, they certainly don't correct employees who engage in this behavior."
The managers do not appreciate the employees. They treat the employees like they are slaves. It can be a bit boring as well without any music to keep you going. It's a ten hour shift so you will want to talk to other people but they will not allow you to talk much.

-Navigating career changes internally can be challenging. Just because you're at the company doesn't mean the process is necessarily easier for changing roles
The salary is good for the work involved. They offer stock however only after a year of employment at the company.
Resources in certain departments could be allocated more efficiently
"organization is now a bloated, political organization. Unless you are a software engineer you will learn more elsewhere, and have greater upside at a Facebook or a start-up. HQs are in MTV, outside of there your career stagnates."

A huge lack of transparency between management. Exceptionally political atmosphere where no one really wants to say the truth: organizations is a company without a central vision.

"Co-workers are a mixed bag as far as work ethic goes. A few lazy employees on the line can ruin everyone else's quota and pallet build.

"Great environment, smart people, leadership is open and upfront, launch and iterate is real and helpful"
Wow I couldn't believe how amazing it was to work at organization. Amazing.
Internal tools proliferation has created a mess for trying to get to basic information. Most people are required to learn/understand SQL Database queries to get any actionable data.
During the orientations we were told their would be many opportunities for promotion from seasonal to full-time employment. Nobody on my floor managed to pull that off.
"Tough, competitive environment"
Still need time find cons.

Very good company to work for.
Colleagues and managers were extremely supportive
Takes time to move up.
The best company I have been to! Learnt a lot and I love the working environment.
"Extremely demanding job physically and mentally, Under constant pressure to meet production rates and quality standards, Hidden undercurrent of politics and favoritism that can be found within most large corporations"
I worked at organization for over 7 years. It is the longest that I have worked at any company. That is a testimonial to how good the company is! I left organization because I wanted to try my hand at starting my own company or joining an early stage start up.
"Love the summer over there, and the working environment"
Can be easily taken for granted due to the lack of selective leadership engagement.
They pay is very low. You feel like a robot. Tooany people breaks are short due to all the people and the metal detectors and badging through the doors.
Lots of opportunity for interesting projects
Managers forget that they play a leader role and like to sit behind the scenes and let the people under their pay grade handle the heavy work.
"High cost of living (Mountain View, CA)"
None that i can think of.
Night shift is not fun. my schedule did not work out well for my family. The workplace was very backstabbing. People always wanted to backstab. Watch out for the bus drivers.
No issues with the leadership principles.
Good Money
"Work long hours, no work-life balance"
A lot of freedom for charting your own path. A lot more encouragement to make yourself productive than being pressured to be productive.
I really liked it it was a easy working environment
Very challenging; expect to learn a lot in a short amount of time. Fast paced. Never a dull moment.
"Dont expect it to be a 40 hr a week job. Brutal demands, low work-life balance, very exhausting. Dont expect rapid promotion-even if you are a unicorn superstar. You got to pay a LOT of dues first."
Above average industry salary.
organizations has great benefits and the pay was okay especially since we were guaranteed overtime. Management was relaxed and they didnt micromanage. You just had to make sure you were performing.
challenging but satisfying. Peer review makes you smile at others all the time
"There are many overqualified and hardworking people here. Just hard work alone will not get you anywhere. You need to source for good projects, work hard and smart in order to have decent career advancement."
the pros are that it's organization
Don't expect lots of hand-holding from management and team leader.
Great benefits; Free Food; Smart Coworkers; Impactful Projects
hard for a returning full time offer
The funs are distracting a little bit.
"Over the years, organization has become more bureaucratic. Unfortunately, several groups are working in the same area and the usual turf battles happen. Also, it has become harder to change projects than before."
None. organization was an amazing place to work!
"You have to be self-directed. Not everyone can do that, and those who don't struggle. We don't do a good job of helping people like that and they end up leaving."
No Opportunity to grow.
Great Learning Opportunities
great place to work. good benefits.
Layoff rate is very high after December
You are not always part of those projects and initiatives.
"It's a large company, and like any big company, there can be bureaucracy. Commuting to Mountain View can be a bit of a drag."
Smart and driven colleagues. Had great direct manager. Hard and interesting problems to solve that really matter.
Not enough organization with high volume of employees.
"You get good pay and great benefits. If productivity is high, you will receive a bonus of 4% as well as your own stock from day one at organizations. Pto, Upt, and vacation time is given on your first day."
it was a good multinational working environment
The company is getting so big that standards can be different from org to org causing confusion for employees
Can get hectic at times
"the management was pretty bad, they didn't really listen to engineers and in particular treated engineering as if they were children"
"organization spoils its employees. Free breakfast lunch and dinner, great amenities, and budgets never seem to be an issue (at other jobs I've had to beg travel budget -- at organization, I can pretty much take any trip I think is worthwhile). They also do tons to reduce friction as an employee."
organization paid very well overall as long as you can pass the interviews.
To many people for them to keep track of
"Politics are starting to get in the way of engineering. Since launches are incentivized so heavily in promo process, negative dogfood feedback is often ignored on the way to launch, with few or no consequences."
Working for organizations is incredibly demanding. The company is highly data driven and every action must be backed with copious amounts of hard data. Do not expect decent work/life balance if working in operations.
Work life balance is not that good
"Incredibly intelligent people who are willing to share their knowledge with you. Great food, lots of opportunity to gain new skills, particularly if you're a new grad."
The people I love doing at I was doing its a lot of fun

Great Pay & lots of overtime available. You WILL stay busy.
The outside a great company.
"I enjoyed my work but didn't feel like what I was doing was terribly important. I was also working on one of organization's smaller campuses, and there was no intern community there."
"No, everything works perfectly. Its very hard to say cons."
More and more problems when growing into a big company.
It is very cool. That's all I have to say
Benefits And Insurance Advancement Growth
Autonomy- no one is going to tell you how to do your job. You decide the best way.
Many teams with uninteresting projects.
"exhausting work, doesn't pay enough for the long hours and quotas we have to meet, same work day in and day out gets very boring"
Does anyone know the starting salary for an internal employee once they become Area Manager?
Sometimes we are not recognized for our good work.
A lot of favoritism
The only negative that I would say for AWS is the salary growth for longer term employees.
"Lack of opportunity for senior talent (staff and above) to really make a dent in the organization. This, coupled with the very slow promo process (1.5 years / level) and organization's tendency to downlevel on hire can be very frustrating. To some extent, I felt like I had to simply wait for leadership to retire or play the political game to get much further in my career."
It was hard to balance my duties at work with time away from work in my personal life. I was constantly on and needed to put out fires
Learning something new everyday. Friendly staff. Good pay. Parties and prizes. Good experience. You learn how to manage time more efficiently.
Creativity encouraged due to lack of standard process.
There are no cons with organization. This is the best company in the world.
You usually work on technically fairly small things because it's a giant company with a lot of resources.

"Dynamic, fast-moving company"
I love working for a company customers love. Every time someone learns I work for organizations I hear a story about why they love Prime or their Kindle. Many people also have great stories about customer service going above and beyond. This is vastly different from other companies I've worked at where the first priority was profit and cool tech regardless of what customers wanted.

Management can sometimes get in the way of you doing things.
"Associate directors, directors, and senior directors are engaged in political battles. Promotions are very political"
"There is a lot of flux at the company (re-orgs on a regular basis), which makes it hard to keep your feet under you. Working at organization and excelling means either being really flexible and quick, or being inflexible and driving forward with your projects no matter the environment."

The first two training weeks are long days and information overload! It may take a bit before you hit your groove of feeling confident in your role. A performance summary offers metrics of how you are doing based on customer response re: solving their issue. When something takes multiple steps and you couldn't solve their issue immediately this metric will count against you. They do look at general improvement trends??Show More

organizations being an E-Commerce is not very user friendly. It was very difficult to obtain information and technical help from other co-workers worldwide.
"Work-life balance could be better. Certain projects seem understaffed. Lots of bureaucracy, which can be frustrating to some people. Not too many cons overall"
"Good Training, lots of exposer, mentorship"
"Ignore the news article from recent NY Times on terrible work culture. I have been working here since 2012 and yes the first few months was hard in terms of understanding how. what and when to get things done. But once i figured out pace, what really matters and dove in I loved going to work everyday and do what I do."
A little unorganized but nothing thst can't be fixed

"All benefits on food, drink. Well life-work balance and provide good environment to work."
Good pay. Well organized company. Great benefits. I worked at a warehouse in the inbound side. They showed me how to operate a forklift and gained a lot of experience on how a warehouse works. 3 days off.

Politics - too much focus on titles and ranks sucking up to other people

This brews a lot of CYA and claiming of credit for whatever you can so that you could be safe come OLR time. There is a lot of lip service to work-life balance and collaboration. Reality is that it is just lip service."

"Great benefits, opportunity to work with smart individuals. NYC building is gorgeous."
you cannot make intelligent decisions
"Work from home, benefits, PTO, Sick Time."
The large size of the company has produced bureaucracy and several layers of teams/departments/orgs that can slow down decision making and progress.
Awesome people awesome culture awesome place to work free food
"My teammates are not great at English, and sometimes results in miscommunication. It's a team-specific problem though, my other organizationr friends don't have this problem."
Many smart people and nice people. People are very understanding and helpful. Lots of opportunity to learn if you actually make the effort to do so.
Long hours (55+) as an unpaid intern.
No room to become full time none contract.. Pay is on the low end.
Good work and life balance
Getting way to big. Levels are everything to everyone. Lower pay than other startups. Inequity of treatment between the sales side and the engineering side of the businesses.

"Fun job, lots of neat things to look at, nice pay."
A lot of tedious work and some off the people are not so great

"hours varied, upper management can be tricky"
stressful work environment
"Great company, awesome product and culture!"
Great place to work for extra money and good part time job
Pay sucks and management is not very good with people.
Harder to transfer between roles
"Competitive, stressful environment. If you are a pessimist, tend to distrust people, or don't really like looking at the big picture, you will have a rough time (and you will give others a rought time). Don't apply if you're not extremely resilient."
"Very good working environment, smart people, great benefit. Also a very good work - life balance"
"politics, process now means that the company moves more slowly that before"
"Everyone is working on things that matter to customers. organizations thinks about the long term; when things go wrong or are unsuccessful, we mine the experience for lessons to be learned and move forward. organizations recognizes that failure is inevitable; it rewards individuals that learn quickly and iterate from failure."
Can get tiresome. Not enough people to do all the work
"Poor chances for promotion,"
clean environment nice work space
I cannot think of any.
"Decent pay, but there are far better opportunities in the area"
Worked to death. I worked 7 days a week for over 8 months. No such thing as work/life balance.
"Insurance, flexibility for going to college if you've been employed for more than a year. If you can become favored among the management, you will receive the ""good"" jobs in the warehouse."
"Good benefits, Paid time off, unpaid time off, medical, dental etc."
Not really any cons about working here
"You'll work a lot at times, but the reward will be an amazing product that creates an opportunity or solves a problem for the customer. Best for those who desire challenge and quick growth opps."
Everyone is so busy that it is hard to connect or make friends at work
"Increasingly red tape gets in the way, and difficult to advance or change roles."
Treat employees really well
Plans/ideas change from day to day and can cause productivity losses

"Demands are high, and the decentralized nature of the company mean that culture can vary from team to team."
"Intelligent coworkers, good company location, and good salaries."
"I'm not going to lie, this is a very hard job, but that's what I love about it. I get to go super deep technically, I've worked with folks to invent cutting edge algorithms, we've routinely delivered against wildly audacious goals, and my team is brilliant.

"It really depends on which team/management you are working with, and since organizations is very big, some employees can have a very different experience than I have."
Benefits are as good as advertised. Company really does view its employees as its largest asset and takes care of them.
"Workload can be daunting at times, FTE's and TVC's are viewed VERY differently in the culture."
"If your idea of work-life balance is heavy on the life and light on the work, you probably won't enjoy this atmosphere. 60+ hour work weeks are pretty much the norm form October to January due to high customer demand. There is a huge disparity between salaries paid to exempt vs non-exempt employees."

I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Commuting into Seattle isn't great and it can be difficult to find parking that is reasonably affordable.
Some associates complain about external hiring. Many associates spend most of their time training others some of which are new management/leadership.
There is terrible work/life balance at this company. You are expected to put in long hours to stay on top of the curve. Less cool employee perks than other large tech companies. Pay is lower than other large tech companies.
"Keeps getting bigger, and adopting thing that big companies use - like stricter budgets"
Customer service has it's cons. Cant ever go a day without having a rude customer calling in demanding things and ruining your day.
Too hard. Too much standing.
Free food amazing perks and overall good pay and benefits and amazing challenges.
"Wants their employees to be happy, will do anything and everything they can do make this happen."
"Excellent working environment, Great food from breakfast to dinner and free transport."
"Because the company is so large, there is a high possibility that someone has already worked on your project so the task of merely digging up prior work and data is a time sink and often frustrating. This means often delivering slower and that could be frustrating for people like me who need to deliver fast."
I don't like having to work all weekend but it is temporary. You do have to work fast to meet productivity. In my department we are expected to scan 160 pieces per hour and sort 200 pieces per hour. Sometimes it's easy but if you get a lot of heavy things to sort it can be difficult.
Amazing work environment to work in
"I liked my bosses and people I worked with. Hourly pay was decent for not needing any experience. It filled a need for a few months and wasn't a big deal when I quit,"
"In general it is a discouraging, sad place to work. Micromanagement seems to be the secret leadership principle."
"Work with great, smart people, in a world leading environment. You will learn a lot and be challenged a lot, and you have a lot of control of your career. Some reviews state you are expected to work hard, often and smart. It is not a direct expectation, but that behavior correlates well with successful organizationsians- who would probably do that anyway."
"Bad middle management, political, slow moving"
"I can't think of any con of organization. If you have the chance, please come to organization."

Nothing really major from my opinion.
Great smart people. All the usual perks
"No need to change a thing, and stay the same."
Relationship driven environment which some times hurt people who are result oriented and doesn't like to gossiping around. I have seen when top performer let go.
Advancement is a bit hit and miss. You can get stuck on a dead-end project (and there are surprisingly many of those at organization).
"Career evolution can be non-existant, so much depends on how good your manager is."
Good pay
The experience can be different for all people. Some of the good things about working here of course are the pay and the people you have a chance to meet.
Big big big - lots of politics/ nothing moves. Leadership skills of leaders on average is low since tech acumen valued by leadership is not.
Great culture. Company really puts employee first.
"There are enough talented people that being talented won't guarantee you an inside track on good projects, because there are thousands of equally smart people ahead in the queue and equally underutilized, but there are just enough bozos that you have to prove that you're not one of them"

Learned a lot in a short period of time. They said 1 year at organizations is like 5 years somewhere else. I felt that way during my 4 years.
"Putting in overtime, your check look nice."
Management is very poor
"Free food, nice work environment and nice salary. And lots of opportunity to be exposed to new technology. And everyone is friendly"
Management and long hours on your feet
Nice coworkers
Many politics and nonsense job set. I dont really like that.
lots of associates there all the time
Break times of 15 minutes include the travel time to refreshments/restrooms.-This place is HUGE(like-8 football fields?) so returning to work within( 15 minutes from scan to scan) is difficult to feel refreshed.
Turned into a big company
The reserves position is awesome because you create your own shift.
very busy and no time to stay with family
Rewarding work environment that pushes you to learn and grow quickly.
"bloated, not as nimble as they think, senior level managers are like gods and can get away with anything without repercussions, people are just numbers - parts to be used and consumed."
"Free food, great benefits, flexible work environment."
It is hard to advance up the mangement chain because people here are so smart. Might be better fit to work at a smaller company
"It's a stressful environment, projects are constantly being assigned, expectation will be raised constantly, etc."
Treated like a glorified babysitter
Leadership team has excellent grip on employee
"I love the intensity, dedication, and energy we all had to put in to make sure every family got what they needed. It has been the most rewarding job I have ever had. It made me feel good when we got done with shipping out all of our orders and breaking records."
"Great coworkers, detailed docs and a lot of learning materials to help you become a good engineer."
"It's a great opportunity for learning. You will get right in the thick of things, and will be given opportunity to do well."
"The work culture is excellent; being nice to others is rewarded socially, and economically. The projects are incredibly diverse, and challenging. And the compensation and perks are very generous. As the person leading the orientation told me on my first day: ""We want you to be happy. If you're happy you're more productive."" I'm happy indeed :)"
Poor work-life balance at work
"much brain wash, and more"
Very big company. Hard to be visible and remember people that you have worked with.
Work/life is/has been a challenge at organizations. Some groups are better than others. Promotions can be hard to come by if you aren't willing or able to sacrifice some of your personal life in order to get it. Not for the faint at heart.
#NAME?
Long hours and stupid team leads
"Nothing! The people are great, customers can be cranky and rude, but other than that it's a great place to work."
too big to do something
"If you are not willing to work hard, then this is not for you"
"benefits, starting pay, philosophy, 4-day workweek, education benefit if you're able to use it."
"Has gained a bit of bureaucracy around actually shipping software, but not too bad, and most of it is intended to prevent wild, west coding."
"It 's becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains"
Work at organization to get free food
"They tend to hire leadership straight out of college who lack any ounce of people skills. They eventually get thrown to the wolves in Which they have to survive in their own with their superiors breathing down their necks, trying to meet unattainable goals. They eventually put all common sense aside and ask too much of there associates. It's no fault of their own, but forget that the monetary benifit from their emplo??Show More"
"The culture is amazing! What you read in the articles about the perks and people is absolutely true. It's great to work at a company that offers 3 meals a day Monday-Friday, where I feel comfortable around 100% of the people and where you have the ability to make your own schedule."
"The company is a lot bigger than it used to be, and though it's done better than most, it can't help slowing down as it grows. Some of the reasons I came to work at organization when it was 1000 employees are no longer true."
People always have helpful advice for you. You will really learn a lot there.
Good food and amazing ppl to work with
